<p><em>NOTE: This document is a work in progress.</em></p>
<p>This document describes the design of the Networking stack on Tock.</p>
<p>The design described in this document is based off of ideas contributed by
Phil Levis, Amit Levy, Paul Crews, Hubert Teo, Mateo Garcia, Daniel Giffin, and
Hudson Ayers.</p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h3>
<p>This document is split into several sections. These are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Principles - Describes the main principles which the design of
this stack intended to meet,
along with some justification of why these principles matter. Ultimately,
the design should follow from these principles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stack Diagram - Graphically depicts the layout of the stack</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explanation of queuing - Describes where packets are queued prior to
transmission.</p>
</li>
<li><p>List of Traits - Describes the traits which will exist at each layer of the
stack. For traits that may seem surprisingly complex, provide examples of
specific messages that require this more complex trait as opposed to the
more obvious, simpler trait that might be expected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Explanation of Queuing - Describe queueing principles for this stack</p>
</li>
<li><p>Description of rx path</p>
</li>
<li><p>Description of the userland interface to the networking stack</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implementation Details - Describes how certain implementations of these
traits will work, providing some examples with pseudocode or commented
explanations of functionality</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example Message Traversals - Shows how different example messages (Thread or
otherwise) will traverse the stack</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Keep the simple case simple</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending an IP packet via an established network should not
require a more complicated interface than send(destination, packet)</li>
<li>If functionality were added to allow for the transmission of IP packets over
the BLE interface, this IP send function should not have to deal with any
options or MessageInfo structs that include 802.15.4 layer information.</li>
<li>This principle reflects a desire to limit the complexity of Thread/the
tock networking stack to the capsules that implement the stack. This
prevents the burden of this complexity from being passed up to whatever
applications use Thread</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Layering is separate from encapsulation</p>
<ul>
<li>Libraries that handle encapsulation should not be contained within any
specific layering construct. For example, If the Thread control unit wants
to encapsulate a UDP payload inside of a UDP packet inside of an IP packet,
it should be able to do so using encapsulation libraries and get the
resulting IP packet without having to pass through all of the protocol layers</li>
<li>Accordingly, implementations of layers can take advantage of these
encapsulation libraries, but are not required to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Dataplane traits are Thread-independent</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, the IP trait should not make any assumption that send()
will be called for a message that will be passed down to the 15.4 layer, in
case this IP trait is used on top of an implementation that passes IP
packets down to be sent over a BLE link layer. Accordingly the IP trait
can not expose any arguments regarding 802.15.4 security parameters.</li>
<li>Even for instances where the only implementation of a trait in the near
future will be a Thread-based implementation, the traits should not
require anything that limit such a trait to Thread-based implementations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Transmission and reception APIs are decoupled</p>
<ul>
<li>This allows for instances where receive and send_done callbacks should
be delivered to different clients (ex: Server listening on all addresses
but also sending messages from specific addresses)</li>
<li>Prevents send path from having to navigate the added complexity required
for Thread to determine whether to forward received messages up the stack</li>

</code></pre><p>Notes on the stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP messages sent via Thread networks are sent through Thread using an IP Send
method that exposes only the parameters specified in the IP_Send trait.
Other parameters of the message (6lowpan decisions, link layer parameters,
many IP header options) are decided by Thread.</li>
<li>The stack provides an interface for the application layer to send
raw IPv6 packets over Thread.</li>
<li>When the Thread control plane generates messages (MLE messages etc.), they are
formatted using calls to the encapsulation libraries and then delivered to the
802.15.4 layer using the 15.4 send function</li>
<li>This stack design allows Thread to control header elements from transport down
to link layer, and to set link layer security parameters and more as required
for certain packers</li>
<li>The application can either directly send IP messages using the IP Send
implementation exposed by the Thread stack or it can use the UDP Send
and TCP send implementation exposed by the Thread stack. If the application
uses the TCP or UDP send implementations it must use the transport packet library
to insert its payload inside a packet and set certain header fields.
The transport send method uses the IP Packet library to set certain
IP fields before handing the packet off to Thread. Thread then sets other
parameters at other layers as needed before sending the packet off via the
15.4 send function implemented for Thread.</li>
<li>Note that currently this design leaves it up to the application layer to
decide what interface any given packet will be transmitted from. This is
because currently we are working towards a minimum functional stack.
However, once this is working we intend to add a layer below the application
layer that would handle interface multiplexing by destination address via a
forwarding table. This should be straightforward to add in to our current
design.</li>
<li>This stack does not demonstrate a full set of functionality we are planning to
implement now. Rather it demonstrates how this setup allows for multiple
implementations of each layer based off of traits and libraries such that a
flexible network stack can be configured, rather than creating a network
stack designed such that applications can only use Thread.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="explanation-of-queuing">Explanation of Queuing</h2>
<p>Queuing happens at the application layer in this stack.
The userland interface to the
networking stack (described in greater detail in Networking_Userland.md)
already handles queueing multiple packets sent from userland apps.
In the kernel, any application which wishes to send multiple UDP packets must
handle queueing itself, waiting for a send_done to return from the radio
before calling send on the next packet in a series of packets.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-traits">List of Traits</h2>
<p>This section describes a number of traits which must be implemented by any
network stack. It is expected that multiple implementations of some of these
traits may exist to allow for Tock to support more than just Thread networking.</p>
<p>Before discussing these traits - a note on buffers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>   Prior implementations of the tock networking stack passed around references
   to &apos;static mut [u8] to pass packets along the stack. This is not ideal from a
   standpoint of wanting
   to be able to prevent as many errors as possible at compile time. The next iteration
   of code will pass &apos;typed&apos; buffers up and down the stack. There are a number
   of packet library traits defined below (e.g. IPPacket, UDPPacket, etc.).
   Transport Layer traits will be implemented by a struct that will contain at least one field -
   a [u8] buffer with lifetime &apos;a. Lower level traits will simply contain
   payload fields that are Transport Level packet traits (thanks to a
   TransportPacket enum). This design allows for all buffers passed to
   be passed as type &apos;UDPPacket&apos;, &apos;IPPacket&apos;, etc. An added advantage of this
   design is that each buffer can easily be operated on using the library
   functions associated with this buffer type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The traits below are organized by the network layer they would typically be
associated with.</p>
<h3 id="transport-layer">Transport Layer</h3>
<p>Thus far, the only transport layer protocol implemented in Tock is UDP.</p>
<p>Documentation describing the structs and traits that define the UDP layer can
be found in capsules/src/net/udp/(udp.rs, udp_send.rs, udp_recv.rs)</p>
<p>Additionally, a driver exists that provides a userland interface via which
udp packets can be sent and received. This is described in greater detail in
Networking_Userland.md</p>
<h3 id="network-stack-receive-path">Network Stack Receive Path</h3>
<ul>
<li>The radio in the kernel has a single <code>RxClient</code>, which is set as the mac layer (awake_mac, typically)</li>
<li>The mac layer (i.e. <code>AwakeMac</code>) has a single <code>RxClient</code>, which is the mac_device(<code>ieee802154::Framer::framer</code>)</li>
<li>The Mac device has a single receive client - <code>MuxMac</code> (virtual MAC device).</li>
<li>The <code>MuxMac</code> can have multiple &quot;users&quot; which are of type <code>MacUser</code></li>
<li>Any received packet is passed to ALL MacUsers, which are expected to filter packets themselves accordingly.</li>
<li>Right now, we initialize two MacUsers in the kernel (in main.rs/components). These are the &apos;radio_mac&apos;, which is the MacUser for the RadioDriver that enables the userland interface to directly send 802154 frames, and udp_mac, the mac layer that is ultimately associated with the udp userland interface.</li>
<li>The udp_mac MacUser has a single receive client, which is the <code>sixlowpan_state</code> struct</li>
<li><code>sixlowpan_state</code> has a single rx_client, which in our case is a single struct that implements the <code>ip_receive</code> trait.</li>
<li>the <code>ip_receive</code> implementing struct (<code>IP6RecvStruct</code>) has a single client, which is udp_recv, a <code>UDPReceive</code> struct.</li>
<li>The UDPReceive struct is a field of the UDPDriver, which ultimately passes the packets up to userland.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are the implications of all this?</p>
<p>1) Currently, any userland app could receive udp packets intended for
anyone else if the app implmenets 6lowpan itself on the received raw frames.</p>
<p>2) Currently, packets are only muxed at the Mac layer.</p>
<p>3) Right now the IPReceive struct receives all IP packets sent to the MAC address of this device, and soon will drop all packets sent to non-local addresses. Right now, the device effectively only has one address anyway, as we only support 6lowpan over 15.4, and as we haven&apos;t implemented a loopback interface on the IP_send path. If, in the future, we implement IP forwarding on Tock, we will need to add an IPSend object to the IPReceiver which would then retransmit any packets received that were not destined for local addresses.</p>
<h2 id="explanation-of-configuration">Explanation of Configuration</h2>
<p>This section describes how the IP stack can be configured, including setting
addresses and other parameters of the MAC layer.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Source IP address: An array of local interfaces on the device is contained in main.rs.
Currently, this array contains two hardcoded addresses, and one address generated from the
unique serial number on the sam4l.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Destination IP address: The destination IP address is configured by passing the address
to the send_to() call when sending IPv6 packets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>src MAC address: This address is configured in main.rs. Currently, the src mac address
for each device is configured by default to be a 16-bit short address representing the last 16 bits
of the unique 120 bit serial number on the sam4l. However, userland apps can change the src address
by calling ieee802154_set_address()</p>
</li>
<li><p>dst MAC address: This is currently a constant set in main.rs. (DST_MAC_ADDR). In the future
this will change, once Tock implements IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.</p>
</li>
<li><p>src pan: This is set via a constant configured in main.rs (PAN_ID). The same constant is used
for the dst pan.</p>
</li>
<li><p>dst pan: Same as src_pan. If we need to support use of the broadcast PAN as a dst_pan, this
may change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>radio channel: Configured as a constant in main.rs (RADIO_CHANNEL).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tock-userland-networking-design">Tock Userland Networking Design</h2>
<p>This section describes the current userland interface for the networking stack
on Tock. This section should serve as a description of the abstraction
provided by libTock - what the exact system call interface looks like or how
libTock or the kernel implements this functionality is out-of-scope of this
document.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Tock networking stack and libTock should attempt to expose a networking
interface that is similar to the POSIX networking interface. The primary
motivation for this design choice is that application programmers are used
to the POSIX networking interface design, and significant amounts of code
have already been written for POSIX-style network interfaces. By designing
the libTock networking interface to be as similar to POSIX as possible, we
hope to improve developer experience while enabling the easy transition of
networking code to Tock.</p>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>udp.c and udp.h in libtock-c/libtock define the userland interface to the
Tock networking stack. These files interact with capsules/src/net/udp/driver.rs
in the main tock repository. driver.rs implements an interface for sending
and receiving UDP messages. It also exposes a list of interace addresses to
the application layer. The primary functionality embedded in the UDP driver
is within the allow(), subscribe(), and command() calls which can be made to
the driver.</p>
<p>Details of this driver can be found in <code>doc/syscalls</code> folder</p>
<p>udp.c and udp.h in libtock-c make it easy to interact with this driver interface.
Important functions available to userland apps written in c include:</p>
<p><code>udp_socket()</code> - sets the port on which the app will receive udp packets,
                 and sets the <code>src_port</code> of outgoing packets sent via that socket. Once socket
                 binding is implemented in the kernel, this function will handle reserving ports
                 to listen on and send from.</p>
<p><code>udp_close()</code> - currently just returns success, but once socket binding has been
                implemented in the kernel, this function will handle freeing bound ports.</p>
<p><code>udp_send_to()</code> - Sends a udp packet to a specified addr/port pair, returns the result
                  of the tranmission once the radio has transmitted it (or once a failure has occured).</p>
<p><code>udp_recv_from_sync()</code> - Pass an interface to listen on and an incoming source address
                         to listen for. Sets up a callback to wait for a received packet, and yeilds until that
                         callback is triggered. This function never returns if a packet is not received.</p>
<p><code>udp_recv_from()</code> - Pass an interface to listen on and an incoming source address to
                    listen for. However, this takes in a buffer to which the received packet should be placed,
                    and returns the callback that will be triggered when a packet is received.</p>
<p><code>udp_list_ifaces()</code> - Populates the passed pointer of ipv6 addresses with the available
                      ipv6 addresses of the interfaces on the device. Right now this merely returns a constant
                      hardcoded into the UDP driver, but should change to return the source IP addresses held
                      in the network configuration file once that is created. Returns up to <code>len</code> addresses.</p>
<p>Other design notes:</p>
<p>The current design of the driver has a few limitations, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Currently, any app can listen on any address/port pair</p>
</li>
<li><p>The current tx implementation allows for starvation, e.g. an app with an earlier app ID can
starve a later ID by sending constantly.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="differences-between-the-apis">Differences Between the APIs</h4>
<p>There are two major differences between the proposed Tock APIs and the standard
POSIX APIs. First, the POSIX APIs must support connection-based protocols such
as TCP, whereas the Tock API is only concerned with connectionless, datagram
based protocols. Second, the POSIX interface has a concept of the <code>sock_addr_t</code>
structure, which is used to encapsulate information such as port numbers to
bind on and interface addresses. This makes <code>bind_to_port</code> redundant in POSIX,
as we can simply set the port number in the <code>sock_addr_t</code> struct when binding.
I think one of the major questions is whether to adopt this convention, or to
use the above definitions for at least the first iteration.</p>

<h2 id="implementation-details-for-potential-future-thread-implementation">Implementation Details for potential future Thread implementation</h2>
<p>This section was written when the networking stack was incomplete, and aspects
may be outdated. This goes for all sections following this point in the document.</p>
<p>The Thread specification determines an entire control plane that spans many
different layers in the OSI networking model. To adequately understand the
interactions and dependencies between these layers&apos; behaviors, it might help to
trace several types of messages and see how each layer processes the different
types of messages. Let&apos;s trace carefully the way OpenThread handles messages.</p>
<p>We begin with the most fundamental message: a data-plane message that does not
interact with the Thread control plane save for passing through a
Thread-defined network interface. Note that some of the procedures in the below
traces will not make sense when taken independently: the responsibility-passing
will only make sense when all the message types are taken as a whole.
Additionally, no claim is made as to whether or not this sequence of callbacks
is the optimal way to express these interactions: it is just OpenThread&apos;s way
of doing it.</p>

  control scheme that determines when messages are sent.</li>
<li>Next, determine the MAC src/dest addresses.<ul>
<li>If this is a direct transmission, there is a source matching scheme to determine if the destination address
used should be short or long. The same length is used for the source MAC address, obtained from the MAC interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notify the MAC layer to notify you that your message can be sent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The MAC layer schedules its transmissions and determines that it can send the above message<ul>
<li>MAC sets the transmission power</li>
<li>MAC sets the channel differently depending on the message type</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The IP6 interface fills up the frame. This is the chance for the IP6 interface to do things like
fragmentation, retransmission, and so on. The MAC layer just wants a frame.<ul>
<li>XXX: The IP6 interface fills up the MAC header. This should really be the responsibility of the MAC layer.
Anyway, here is what is done:<ul>
<li>Channel, source PAN ID, destination PAN ID, and security modes are determined by message type.
Note that the channel set by the MAC layer is sometimes overwritten.</li>
<li>A mesh extension header is added for some messages. (eg. indirect transmissions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The IP6 message is then 6LoWPAN-compressed/fragmented into the payload section of the frame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The MAC layer receives the raw frame and tries to send it<ul>
<li>MAC sets the sequence number of the frame (from the previous sequence number for the correct link neighbor),
if it is not a retransmission</li>
<li>The frame is secured if needed. This is another can of worms:<ul>
<li>Frame counter is dependent on the link neighbor and whether or not the frame is a retransmission</li>
<li>Key is dependent on which key id mode is selected, and also the link neighbor&apos;s key sequence</li>
<li>Key sequence != frame counter</li>
<li>One particular mode requires using a key, source and frame counter that is a Thread-defined constant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The frame is transmitted, an ACK is waited for, and the process completes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, the data dependencies are nowhere as clean as the OSI model
dictates. The complexity mostly arises because</p>
<ul>
<li>Layer 4 checksum can include IPv6 pseudoheader</li>
<li>IP6 source address (mesh local? link local? multicast?) is determined by
interface and destination address</li>
<li>MAC src/dest addresses are dependent on the next device on the route to the
IP6 destination address</li>
<li>Channel, src/dest PAN ID, security is dependent on message type</li>
<li>Mesh extension header presence is dependent on message type</li>
<li>Sequence number is dependent on message type and destination</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all of the MAC layer dependencies in step 5 can be pre-decided so
that the MAC layer is the only one responsible for writing the MAC header.</p>
<p>This gives a pretty good overview of what minimally needs to be done to even be
able to send normal IPv6 datagrams, but does not cover all of Thread&apos;s
complexities. Next, we look at some control-plane messages.</p>
<h3 id="control-plane-mle-messages">Control plane: MLE messages</h3>
<ol>
<li>The MLE layer encapsulates its messages in UDP on a constant port<ul>
<li>Security is determined by MLE message type. If MLE-layer security is
required, the frame is secured using the same CCM* encryption scheme used
in the MAC layer, but with a different key discipline.</li>
<li>MLE key sequence is global across a single Thread device</li>
<li>MLE sets IP6 source address to the interface&apos;s link local address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This UDP-encapsulated MLE message is sent to the IP6 dispatch again</li>
<li>The actual IP6 interface (Thread-controlled) tries to send that message</li>
<li>The MAC layer schedules the transmission</li>
<li>The IP6 interface fills up the frame.<ul>
<li>MLE messages disable link-layer security when MLE-layer security is
present. However, if link-layer security is disabled and the MLE message
doesn&apos;t fit in a single frame, link-layer security is enabled so that
fragmentation can proceed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The MAC layer receives the raw frame and tries to send it</li>
</ol>
<p>The only cross-layer dependency introduced by the MLE layer is the dependency
between MLE-layer security and link-layer security. Whether or not the MLE
layer sits atop an actual UDP socket is an implementation detail.</p>
<h3 id="control-plane-mesh-forwarding">Control plane: Mesh forwarding</h3>
<p>If Thread REED devices are to be eventually supported in Tock, then we must
also consider this case. If a frame is sent to a router which is not its final
destination, then the router must forward that message to the next hop.</p>
<ol>
<li>The MAC layer receives a frame, decrypts it and passes it to the IP6 interface</li>
<li>The IP6 reception reads the frame and realizes that it is an indirect
transmission that has to be forwarded again<ul>
<li>The frame must contain a mesh header, and the HopsLeft field in it should
be decremented</li>
<li>The rest of the payload remains the same</li>
<li>Hence, the IP6 interface needs to send a raw 6LoWPAN-compressed frame</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The IP6 transmission interface receives a raw 6LoWPAN-compressed frame to be
transmitted again<ul>
<li>This frame must still be scheduled: it might be destined for a sleepy
device that is not yet awake</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The MAC layer schedules the transmission</li>
<li>The IP6 transmission interface copies the frame to be retransmitted
verbatim, but with the modified mesh header and a new MAC header</li>
<li>The MAC layer receives the raw frame and tries to send it</li>
</ol>
<p>This example shows that the IP6 transmission interface may need to handle more
message types than just IP6 datagrams: there is a case where it is convenient
to be able to handle a datagram that is already 6LoWPAN compressed.</p>
<h3 id="control-plane-mac-data-polling">Control plane: MAC data polling</h3>
<p>From time to time, a sleepy edge device will wake up and begin polling its
parent to check if any frames are available for it. This is done via a MAC
command frame, which must still be sent through the transmission pipeline with
link security enabled (Key ID mode 1).  OpenThread does this by routing it
through the IP6 transmission interface, which arguably isn&apos;t the right choice.</p>
<ol>
<li>Data poll manager send a data poll message directly to the IP6 transmission
interface, skipping the IP6 dispatch</li>
<li>The IP6 transmission interface notices the different type of message, which
always warrants a direct transmission.</li>
<li>The MAC layer schedules the transmission</li>
<li>The IP6 transmission interface fills in the frame<ul>
<li>The MAC dest is set to the parent of this node and the MAC src is set to be
the same length as the address of the parent</li>
<li>The payload is filled up to contain the Data Request MAC command</li>
<li>The MAC security level and key ID mode is also fixed for MAC commands under
the Thread specification</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The MAC layer secures the frame and sends it out</li>
</ol>
<p>We could imagine giving the data poll manager direct access as a client of the
MAC layer to avoid having to shuffle data through the IP6 transmission
interface. This is only justified because MAC command frames are never
6LoWPAN-compressed or fragmented, nor do they depend on the IP6 interface in
any way.</p>
<h3 id="control-plane-child-supervision">Control plane: Child supervision</h3>
<p>This type of message behaves similarly to the MAC data polls. The message is
essentially and empty MAC frame, but OpenThread chooses to also route it
through the IP6 transmission interface. It would be far better to allow a child
supervision implementation to be a direct client of the MAC interface.</p>
<h3 id="control-plane-joiner-entrust-and-mle-announce">Control plane: Joiner entrust and MLE announce</h3>
<p>These two message types are also explicitly marked, because they require a
specific Key ID Mode to be selected when producing the frame for the MAC
interface.</p>
<h3 id="caveat-about-mac-layer-security">Caveat about MAC layer security</h3>
<p>So far, it seems like we can expect the MAC layer to have no cross-layer
dependencies: it receives frames with a completely specified description of how
they are to be secured and transmitted, and just does so. However, this is not
entirely the case.</p>
<p>When the frame is being secured, the key ID mode has been set by the upper
layers as described above, and this key ID mode is used to select between a few
different key disciplines. For example, mode 0 is only used by Joiner entrust
messages and uses the Thread KEK sequence. Mode 1 uses the MAC key sequence and
Mode 2 is a constant key used only in MLE announce messages. Hence, this key ID
mode selection is actually enabling an upper layer to determine the specific
key being used in the link layer.</p>
<p>Note that we cannot just reduce this dependency by allowing the upper layer to
specify the key used in MAC encryption. During frame reception, the MAC layer
itself has to know which key to use in order to decrypt the frames correctly.</p>
