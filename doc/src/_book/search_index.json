Tock assumes the hardware includes a memory protection unit\n(MPU), as systems without an MPU cannot simultaneously support untrusted\nprocesses and retain Tock's safety and security properties. The Tock kernel and\nits extensions (called capsules) are written in Rust.\nTock can run multiple, independent untrusted processes written in\nany language. The number of processes Tock can simultaneously support\nis constrained by MCU flash and RAM. Tock can be configured to use different\nscheduling algorithms, but the default Tock scheduler is preemptive and\nuses a round-robin policy. Tock uses a microkernel architecture: complex\ndrivers and services are often implemented as untrusted processes, which\nother processes, such as applications, can invoke through inter-process\ncommmunication (IPC).\nThis document gives an overview of Tock's architecture, the different\nclasses of code in Tock, the protection mechanisms it uses, and how this\nstructure is reflected in the software's directory structure.\n\n\n\nTock Architecture\nTock Directory Structure\n\n\nTock Architecture\n\nThe above Figure shows Tock's architecture. Code falls into one of three\ncategories: the core kernel, capsules, and processes.\nThe core kernel and capsules are both written in Rust. Rust is a\ntype-safe systems language; other documents discuss the language and\nits implications to kernel design in greater detail, but the\nkey idea is that Rust code can't use memory differently than intended\n(e.g., overflow buffers, forge pointers, or have pointers to dead\nstack frames). Because these restrictions prevent many things that\nan OS kernel has to do (such as access a peripheral that exists at a\nmemory address specified in a datasheet), the very small core kernel\nis allowed to break them by using \"unsafe\" Rust code. Capsules,\nhowever, cannot use unsafe features. This means that the core kernel\ncode is very small and carefully written, while new capsules added\nto the kernel are safe code and so do not have to be trusted.\nProcesses can be written in any language. The kernel protects itself and\nother processes from bad process code by using a hardware memory\nprotection unit (MPU). If a process tries to access memory it's not\nallowed to, this triggers an exception. The kernel handles this exception\nand kills the process.\nThe kernel provides four major system calls:\n\ncommand: makes a call from the process into the kernel\nsubscribe: registers a callback in the process for an upcall from the kernel\nallow: gives kernel access to memory in the process\nyield: suspends process until after a callback is invoked\n\nEvery system call except yield is non-blocking. Commands that\nmight take a long time (such as sending a message over a UART)\nreturn immediately and issue a callback when they complete.\nThe yield system call blocks the process until a callback\nis invoked; userland code typically implements blocking\nfunctions by invoking a command and then using yield to wait\nuntil the callback completes.\nThe command, subscribe, and allow system calls all take a driver\nID as their first parameter. This indicates which driver in the\nkernel that system call is intended for. Drivers are capsules that\nimplement the system call.\nTock Directory Structure\nTock has several principal code directories.\n\narch: stores architecture-specific code. I.e., code that\nis Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M4 specific. This includes code for performing\ncontext switches and making system calls (trapping from user code to\nkernel code).\n\nboards: contains code for specific Tock platforms, such as\nthe imix, the Hail, and the nrf52dk. This is typically the structure\nthat defines all of the capsules the kernel has, the code to configure the\nMCU's IO pins into the proper states, initializing the kernel and loading\nprocesses. The principal file in this directory is main.rs, and the\nprincipal initialization function is reset_handler (which executes\nwhen the MCU resets). The board code also defines how system call device\nidentifiers map to capsules, in the with_driver function.\n\ncapsules: contains MCU-independent kernel extensions that\ncan build on top of chip-specific implementations of particular peripherals.\nSome capsules provide system calls. For example, the spi module in capsules\nbuilds on top of a chip's SPI implementation to provide system calls on\ntop of it.\n\nchips: contains microcontroller-specific code, such as the\nimplementations of SPI, I2C, GPIO, UART, and other microcontroller-specific\ncode. The distinction between chips and boards is the difference between\na microcontroller and a full platform. For example, many microcontrollers\nhave multiple UARTs. Which UART is the principal way to communicate with\nTock, or which is used to control another chip, is defined by how the chip\nis placed on board and which pins are exposed. So a chip provides the UART\nimplementation, but a board defines which UART is used for what.\n\ndoc: contains the documentation for Tock, including\nspecifications for internal interfaces and tutorials.\n\nkernel: contains microcontroller-independent kernel code,\nsuch as the scheduler, processes, and memory management. This directory\nand arch are where all core kernel code reside.\n\nlibraries: contains libraries that we use internally and share\nexternally. Several primitives have been created for Tock that we think could\nalso be useful to other projects. This is a location where each crate is\nlocated.\n\ntools: contains associated tools to help in compilation and\ncode maintenance, such as checking code formatting, converting binaries,\nand build scripts.\n\nvagrant: contains information on how to get Tock running in a\nvirtual machine-esque environment.\n\n\n"},"Design.html":{"url":"Design.html","title":"Design","keywords":"","body":"Tock Design\n\n\n\nArchitecture\nCapsules\nProcesses\nMemory Layout\n\n\nGrants\n\n\nIn-Kernel Design Principles\nRole of HILs\nSplit-phase Operation\nNo External Dependencies\nUsing unsafe and Capabilities\nEase of Use and Understanding\nDemonstrated Features\nMerge Aggressively, Archive Unabashedly\n\n\n\n\nMost operating systems provide isolation between components using a process-like\nabstraction: each component is given its own slice of the system memory (for\nits stack, heap, data) that is not accessible by other components. Processes\nare great because they provide a convenient abstraction for both isolation and\nconcurrency. However, on resource-limited systems, like microcontrollers with\nmuch less than 1MB of memory, this approach leads to a trade-off between\nisolation granularity and resource consumption.\nTock's architecture resolves this trade-off by using a language sandbox to\nisolated components and a cooperative scheduling model for concurrency in the\nkernel. As a result, isolation is (more or less) free in terms of resource\nconsumption at the expense of preemptive scheduling (so a malicious component\ncould block the system by, e.g., spinning in an infinite loop).\nTo first order, all components in Tock, including those in the kernel, are\nmutually distrustful. Inside the kernel, Tock achieves this with a\nlanguage-based isolation abstraction called capsules that incurs no memory or\ncomputation overhead. In user-space, Tock uses (more-or-less) a traditional\nprocess model where process are isolated from the kernel and each other using\nhardware protection mechanisms.\nIn addition, Tock is designed with other embedded systems-specific goals in\nmind. Tock favors overall reliability of the system and discourages components\n(prevents when possible) from preventing system progress when buggy.\nArchitecture\n\nTock includes three architectural components: a small trusted kernel, written in\nRust, which implements a hardware abstraction layer (HAL); scheduler; and\nplatform-specific configuration. Other system components are implemented in one\nof two protection mechanisms: capsules, which are compiled with the kernel and\nuse Rust’s type and module systems for safety, and processes, which use the MPU\nfor protection at runtime.\nSystem components (an application, driver, virtualization layer, etc.) can be\nimplemented in either a capsule or process, but each mechanism trades off\nconcurrency and safety with memory consumption, performance, and granularity.\n\n\n\nCategory\nCapsule\nProcess\n\n\n\n\nProtection\nLanguage\nHardware\n\n\nMemory Overhead\nNone\nSeparate stack\n\n\nProtection Granularity\nFine\nCoarse\n\n\nConcurrency\nCooperative\nPreemptive\n\n\nUpdate at Runtime\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\nAs a result, each is more appropriate for implementing different components. In\ngeneral, drivers and virtualization layers are implemented as capsules, while\napplications and complex drivers using existing code/libraries, such as\nnetworking stacks, are implemented as processes.\nCapsules\nA capsule is a Rust struct and associated functions. Capsules interact with each\nother directly, accessing exposed fields and calling functions in other\ncapsules. Trusted platform configuration code initializes them, giving them\naccess to any other capsules or kernel resources they need. Capsules can protect\ninternal state by not exporting certain functions or fields.\nCapsules run inside the kernel in privileged hardware mode, but Rust’s type and\nmodule systems protect the core kernel from buggy or malicious capsules. Because\ntype and memory safety are enforced at compile-time, there is no overhead\nassociated with safety, and capsules require minimal error checking. For\nexample, a capsule never has to check the validity of a reference. If the\nreference exists, it points to valid memory of the right type. This allows\nextremely fine-grained isolation since there is virtually no overhead to\nsplitting up components.\nRust’s language protection offers strong safety guarantees. Unless a capsule is\nable to subvert the Rust type system, it can only access resources explicitly\ngranted to it, and only in ways permitted by the interfaces those resources\nexpose. However, because capsules are cooperatively scheduled in the same\nsingle-threaded event loop as the kernel, they must be trusted for system\nliveness. If a capsule panics, or does not yield back to the event handler, the\nsystem can only recover by restarting.\nProcesses\nProcesses are independent applications that are isolated from the kernel and run\nwith reduced privileges in separate execution threads from the kernel. The\nkernel schedules processes preemptively, so processes have stronger system\nliveness guarantees than capsules. Moreover, uses hardware protection to enforce\nprocess isolation at runtime. This allows processes to be written in any\nlanguage and to be safely loaded at runtime.\nMemory Layout\nProcesses are isolated from each other, the kernel, and the underlying hardware\nexplicitly by the hardware Memory Protection Unit (MPU). The MPU limits which\nmemory addresses a process can access. Accesses outside of a process’s permitted\nregion result in a fault and trap to the kernel.\nCode, stored in flash, is made\naccessible with a read-only memory protection region. Each process is allocated\na contiguous region of RAM. One novel aspect of a process is the presence of a\n“grant” region at the top of the address space. This is memory allocated to the\nprocess covered by a memory protection region that the process can neither read\nnor write. The grant region, discussed below, is needed for the kernel to be able\nto borrow memory from a process in order to ensure liveness and safety in\nresponse to system calls.\nGrants\nCapsules are not allowed to allocate memory dynamically since dynamic\nallocation in the kernel makes it hard to predict if memory will be exhausted.\nA single capsule with poor memory management could cause the rest of the kernel\nto fail. Moreover, since it uses a single stack, the kernel cannot easily\nrecover from capsule failures.\nHowever, capsules often need to dynamically allocate memory in response to\nprocess requests. For example, a virtual timer driver must allocate a structure\nto hold metadata for each new timer any process creates. Therefore, Tock allows\ncapsules to dynamically allocate from the memory of a process making a request.\nIt is unsafe, though, for a capsule to directly hold a reference to process\nmemory. Processes crash and can be dynamically loaded, so, without explicit\nchecks throughout the kernel code, it would not be possible to ensure that a\nreference to process memory is still valid.\nFor a capsule to safely allocate memory from a process, the kernel must enforce\nthree properties:\n\nAllocated memory does not allow capsules to break the type system.\n\nCapsules can only access pointers to process memory while the process is\nalive.\n\nThe kernel must be able to reclaim memory from a terminated process.\n\n\nTock provides a safe memory allocation mechanism that meets these three\nrequirements through memory grants. Capsules can allocate data of arbitrary\ntype from the memory of processes that interact with them. This memory is\nallocated from the grant segment.\nJust as with buffers passed through allow, references to granted memory are\nwrapped in a type-safe struct that ensures the process is still alive before\ndereferencing. Unlike shared buffers, which can only be a buffer type in a\ncapsule, granted memory can be defined as any type. Therefore, processes cannot\naccess this memory since doing so might violate type-safety.\nIn-Kernel Design Principles\nTo help meet Tock's goals, encourage portability across hardware, and ensure a\nsustainable operating system, several design principles have emerged over time\nfor the Tock kernel. These are general principles that new contributions to the\nkernel should try to uphold. However, these principles have been informed by\nTock's development, and will likely continue to evolve as Tock and the Rust\necosystem evolve.\nRole of HILs\nGenerally, the Tock kernel is structured into three layers:\n\nChip-specific drivers: these typically live in a crate in the\nchips subdirectory, or an equivalent crate in an different repository\n(e.g. the Titan port is out of tree but its h1b create is the\nequivalent here). These drivers have implementations that are specific\nto the hardware of a particular microcontroller. Ideally,\ntheir implementation is fairly simple, and they merely adhere to a\ncommon interface (a HIL). That's not always the case, but that's\nthe ideal.\n\nChip-agnostic, portable, peripheral drivers and subsystems. These\ntypically live in the capsules crate. These include things like\nvirtual alarms and virtual I2C stack, as well as drivers for\nhardware peripherals not on the chip itself (e.g. sensors, radios,\netc). These drivers typically rely on the chip-specific drivers\nthrough the HILs.\n\nSystem call drivers, also typically found in the capsules\ncrate. These are the drivers that implement a particular part of\nthe system call interfaces, and are often even more abstracted from\nthe hardware than (2) - for example, the temperature sensor system\ncall driver can use any temperature sensor, including several\nimplemented as portable peripheral drivers.\n\n\n   The system call interface is another point of\n   standardization that can be implemented in various ways. So it’s\n   perfectly reasonable to have several implementations of the same\n   system call interface that use completely different hardware\n   stacks, and therefore HILs and chip-specific drivers (e.g. a\n   console driver that operates over USB might just be implemented as\n   a different system call driver that implements the same system\n   calls, rather than trying to fit USB into the UART HIL).\nBecause of their importance, the interfaces between these layers are a key part\nof Tock's design and implementation. These interfaces are called Tock's Hardware\nInterface Layer, or HIL. A HIL is a portable collection of Rust traits that can\nbe implemented in either a portable or a non-portable way. An example of a\nnon-portable implementation of a HIL is an Alarm that is implemented in terms of\ncounter and compare registers of a specific chip, while an example of a portable\nimplementation is a virtualization layer that multiplexes multiple Alarms top of\na single underlying Alarm.\nA HIL consists of one or more Rust traits that are intended to be used together.\nIn some cases, implementations may only implement a subset of a HIL's traits.\nFor example the analog-to-digital (ADC) conversion HIL may have traits both for\nsingle and streams of samples. A particular implementation may only support\nsingle samples and so not implement the streaming traits.\nThe choice of particular HIL interfaces is pretty important, and we have some\ngeneral principles we follow:\n\nHIL implementations should be fairly general. If we have an interface that\ndoesn't work very well across different hardware, we probably have the wrong\ninterface - it's either too high level, or too low level, or it's just not\nflexible enough. But HILs shouldn't generally be designed to optimize for\nparticular applications or hardware, and definitely not for a particular\ncombination of applications and hardware. If there are cases where that is\nreally truly necessary, a driver can be very chip or board specific and\ncircumvent the HILs entirely.\nSometimes there are useful interfaces that some chips can provide natively,\nwhile other chips lack the necessary hardware support, but the functionality\ncould be emulated in some way. In these cases, Tock sometimes uses\n\"advanced\" traits in HILs that enable a chip to expose its more\nsophisticated features while not requiring that all implementors of the HIL\nhave to implement the function. For example, the UART HIL includes a\nReceiveAdvanced trait that includes a special function\nreceive_automatic() which receives bytes on the UART until a pause between\nbytes is detected. This is supported directly by the SAM4L hardware, but can\nalso be emulated using timers and GPIO interrupts. By including this in an\nadvanced trait, capsules can still use the interface but other UART\nimplementations that do not have that required feature do not have to\nimplement it.\n\nA HIL implementation may assume it is the only way the device will be used.\nAs a result, Tock tries to avoid having more than one HIL for a particular\nservice or abstraction, because it will not, in general, be possible for the\nkernel to support simultaneously using different HILs for the same device.\nFor example, suppose there were two different HILs for a UART with slightly\ndifferent APIs. The chip-specific implementation of each one will need to\nread and write hardware registers and handle interrupts, so they cannot exist\nsimultaneously. By allowing a HIL to assume it is the only way the device\nwill be used, Tock allows HILs to precisely define their semantics without\nhaving to worry about potential future conflicts or use cases.\n\n\nSplit-phase Operation\nWhile processes are time sliced and preemptive in Tock, the kernel is\nnot. Everything is run-to-completion. That is an important design\nchoice because it allows the kernel to avoid allocating lots of stacks\nfor lots of tasks, and it makes it possible to reason more simply\nabout static and other shared variables.\nTherefore, all I/O operations in the Tock kernel are asynchronous and\nnon-blocking. A method call starts an operation and returns immediately. When\nthe operation completes, the struct implementing the operation calls a callback.\nTock uses callbacks rather than closures because closures typically require\ndynamic memory allocation, which the kernel avoids and does not generally\nsupport.\nThis design does add complexity when writing drivers as a blocking API is\ngenerally simpler to use. However, this is a conscious choice to favor overall\nsafety of the kernel (e.g. avoiding running out of memory or preventing other\ncode from running on time) over functional correctness of individual drivers\n(because they might be more error-prone, not because they cannot be written\ncorrectly).\nThere are limited cases when the kernel can briefly block. For example, the\nSAM4L's GPIO controller can take up to 5 cycles to become ready between\noperations. Technically, a completely asynchronous driver would make this\nsplit-phase: the operation returns immediately, and issues a callback when it\ncompletes. However, because just setting up the callback will take more than 5\ncycles, spinning for 5 cycles is not only simpler, it's also cheaper. The\nimplementation therefore spins for a handful of cycles before returning, such\nthat the operation is synchronous. These cases are rare, though: the operation\nhas to be so fast that it's not worth allowing other code to run during the\ndelay.\nNo External Dependencies\nTock chooses to not use any external libraries for any of the crates in the\nkernel. This is done to promote safety, as auditing the Tock code only requires\ninspecting the code in the Tock repository. Tock tries to be very specific with\nits use of unsafe, and tries to ensure that when it is used it is clear as to\nwhy. With external dependencies it would be significantly more challenging to\nensure that uses of unsafe are valid, particularly as external libraries\nevolve.\nWe also realize, however, that external libraries can be very useful. Tock's\ncompromise has been to pull in specific portions of libraries into the\nlibraries folder. This puts the library's source in the same repository, while\nkeeping the library as a clearly separate crate. We do try to limit how often\nthis happens.\nIn the future, we hope that cargo and other Rust tools make it significantly\neasier to audit and manage dependencies. For example, cargo currently has no\nmechanism to emit an error if a dependency uses unsafe. If new tools emerge\nthat help ensure that dependent code is safe, Tock would likely be able to\nleverage external dependencies.\nUsing unsafe and Capabilities\nTock attempts to minimize the amount of unsafe code in the kernel. Of course,\nthere are a number of operations that the kernel must do which fundamentally\nviolate Rust's memory safety guarantees, and we try to compartmentalize these\noperations and explain how to use them in an ultimately safe manner.\nFor operations that violate Rust safety, Tock marks the functions, structs, and\ntraits as unsafe. This restricts the crates that can use these elements.\nGenerally, Tock tries to make it clear where an unsafe operation is occurring by\nrequiring the unsafe keyword be present. For example, with memory-mapped\ninput/output (MMIO) registers, casting an arbitrary pointer to a struct that\nrepresents those registers violates memory safety unless the register map and\naddress are verified to be correct. To denote this, doing the cast is clearly\nmarked as unsafe. However, once the cast is complete, accessing those\nregisters no longer violates memory safety. Therefore, using the registers does\nnot require the unsafe keyword.\nNot all potentially dangerous code violates Rust's safety model, however. For\nexample, stopping a process from running on the board does not violate\nlanguage-level safety, but is still a potentially problematic operation from a\nsecurity and system reliability standpoint, as not all kernel code should be\nable halt arbitrary processes (in particular, untrusted capsules should not have\nthis access to this API). One way to restrict access to these types of functions\nwould be to re-use the unsafe mechanism, since cargo will emit a warning if\ncode that is prohibited from using unsafe attempts to invoke an unsafe\nfunction. However, this muddles the use of unsafe, and makes it difficult to\nunderstand if code potentially violates safety or is a restricted API.\nInstead, Tock uses\ncapabilities\nto restrict access to important APIs. As such, any public APIs inside the kernel\nthat should be very restricted in what other code can use them should require a\nspecific capability in their function signatures. This prevents code that has\nnot explicitly been granted the capability from calling the protected API.\nTo promote the principle of least privilege, capabilities are relatively\nfine-grained and provide narrow access to specific APIs. This means that\ngenerally new APIs will require defining new capabilities.\nEase of Use and Understanding\nWhenever possible, Tock's design optimizes to lower the barrier for new users or\ndevelopers to understand and use Tock. Sometimes, this means intentionally\nmaking a design choice that prioritizes readability or clarity over performance.\nAs an example, Tock generally avoids using Rust's\nfeatures\nand #[cfg()] attribute to enable conditional compilation. While using a set of\nfeatures can lead to optimizing exactly what code should be included when the\nkernel is built, it also makes it very difficult for users unfamiliar with the\nfeatures to decide which features to enable and when. Likely, these users will\nuse the default configuration, reducing the benefit of having the features\navailable. Also, conditional compilation makes it very difficult to understand\nexactly what version of the kernel is running on any particular board as the\nfeatures can substantially change what code is running. Finally, the non-default\noptions are unlikely to be tested as robustly as the default configuration,\nleading to versions of the kernel which are no longer available.\nTock also tries to ensure Tock \"just works\" for users. This manifests by trying\nto minimize the number of steps to get Tock running. The build system uses\nmake which is familiar to many developers, and just running make in a board\nfolder will compile the kernel. The most supported boards (Hail and imix) can\nthen be programmed by just running make program. Installing an app just\nrequires one more command: tockloader install blink. Tockloader will continue\nto expand to support the ease-of-use with Tock. Now, \"just works\" is a design\ngoal that Tock is not completely meeting. But, future design decisions should\ncontinue to encourage Tock to \"just work\".\nDemonstrated Features\nTock discourages adding functionality to the kernel unless a clear use case has\nbeen established. For example, adding a red-black tree implementation to\nkernel/src/common might be useful in the future for some new Tock feature.\nHowever, that would be unlikely to be merged without a use case inside of the\nkernel that motivates needing a red-black tree. This general principle provides\na starting point for evaluating new features in pull requests.\nRequiring a use case also makes the code more likely to be tested and used, as\nwell as updated as other internal kernel APIs change.\nMerge Aggressively, Archive Unabashedly\nAs an experimental embedded operating system with roots in academic research,\nTock is likely to receive contributions of new, risky, experimental, or narrowly\nfocused code that may or may not be useful for the long-term growth of Tock.\nRather than use a \"holding\" or \"contribution\" repository for new, experimental\ncode, Tock tries to merge new features into mainline Tock. This both eases the\nmaintenance burden of the code (it doesn't have to be maintained out-of-tree)\nand makes the feature more visible.\nHowever, not all features catch on, or are completed, or prove useful, and having the\ncode in mainline Tock becomes an overall maintenance burden. In these cases, Tock\nwill move the code to an archive repository.\n"},"threat_model/":{"url":"threat_model/","title":"Threat Model","keywords":"","body":"Tock Threat Model\nNote: This threat model is not descriptive of Tock's current implementation.\nIt describes how we intend Tock to work as of some future release, perhaps\n2.0.\nOverview\nTock provides hardware-based isolation between processes as well as\nlanguage-based isolation between kernel capsules.\nTock supports a variety of hardware, including boards defined in the Tock\nrepository and boards defined \"out of tree\" in a separate repository.\nAdditionally, Tock's installation model may vary between different use cases\neven when those use cases are based on the same hardware. As a result of Tock's\nflexibility, the mechanisms it uses to provide isolation — and the strength of\nthat isolation — vary from deployment to deployment.\nThis threat model describes the isolation provided by Tock as well as the trust\nmodel that Tock uses to implement that isolation. Users of Tock, which include\nboard integrators and application developers, should use this threat model to\nunderstand what isolation Tock provides to them (and what isolation it may not\nprovide). Tock developers should use this threat model as a guide for how to\nprovide Tock's isolation guarantees.\nDefinitions\nThese definitions are shared between the documents in this directory.\nA process is a runtime instantiation of an application binary. When an\napplication binary \"restarts\", its process is terminated and a new process is\nstarted using the same binary. Note that the kernel is not considered a process,\nalthough it is a thread of execution.\nProcess data includes a process' binary in non-volatile storage, its memory\nfootprint in RAM, and any data that conceptually belongs to the process that is\nheld by the kernel or other processes. For example, if a process is reading from\na UART then the data in the UART buffer is considered the process' data, even\nwhen it is stored in a location in RAM only readable by the kernel.\nKernel data includes the kernel's image in non-volatile storage as well as\ndata in RAM that does not conceptually belong to processes. For example, the\nscheduler's data structures are kernel data.\nCapsule data is data that is associated with a particular kernel capsule.\nThis data can be either kernel data or process data, depending on its\nconceptual owner. For example, an ADC driver's configuration is kernel data,\nwhile samples an ADC driver takes on behalf of a process are process data.\nTock's users refers to entities that make use of Tock OS. In the context of\nthreat modelling, this typically refers to board integrators (entities that\ncombine Tock components into an OS to run on a specific piece of hardware) and\napplication developers (who consume Tock's APIs and rely on the OS' guarantees).\nIsolation Provided to Processes\nConfidentiality: A process' data may not be accessed by other processes or\nby capsules, unless explicitly permitted by the process. Note that Tock does not\ngenerally provide defense against side channel attacks; see the Side Channel\nDefense heading below for more details. Additionally,\nVirtualization describes some limitations on isolation for\nshared resources.\nIntegrity: Process data may not be modified by other processes or by\ncapsules, except when allowed by the process.\nAvailability: Processes may not deny service to each other at runtime. As an\nexception to this rule, some finite resources may be allocated on a\nfirst-come-first-served basis. This exception is described in detail in\nVirtualization.\nIsolation Provided to Kernel Code\nConfidentiality: Kernel data may not be accessed by processes, except where\nexplicitly permitted by the owning component. Kernel data may not be accessed by\ncapsules, except where explicitly permitted by the owning component. The\nlimitations about side channel defense and\nVirtualization that apply to process data also apply to\nkernel data.\nIntegrity: Processes and capsules may not modify kernel data except through\nAPIs intentionally exposed by the owning code.\nAvailability: Processes cannot starve the kernel of resources or otherwise\nperform denial-of-service attacks against the kernel. This does not extend to\ncapsule code; capsule code may deny service to trusted kernel code. As described\nin Virtualization, kernel APIs should be designed to\nprevent starvation.\nIsolation that Tock does NOT Provide\nThere are practical limits to the isolation that Tock can provide; this section\ndescribes some of those limits.\nSide Channel Defense\nIn general, Tock's users should assume that Tock does NOT provide side channel\nmitigations except where Tock's documentation indicates side channel mitigations\nexist.\nTock's answer to \"should code X mitigate side channel Y\" is generally \"no\". Many\nside channels that Tock can mitigate in theory are too expensive for Tock to\nmitigate in practice. As a result, Tock does not mitigate side channels by\ndefault. However, specific Tock components may provide and document their own\nside channel mitigation. For instance, Tock may provide a cryptography API that\nimplements constant-time operations, and may document the side channel defense\nin the cryptography API's documentation.\nIn deciding whether to mitigate a side channel, Tock developers should consider\nboth the cost of mitigating the side channel as well as the value provided by\nmitigating that side channel. For example:\n\nTock does not hide a process' CPU usage from other processes. Hiding CPU\nutilization generally requires making significant performance tradeoffs, and\nCPU utilization is not a particularly sensitive signal.\n\nAlthough Tock protects a process' data from unauthorized access, Tock does\nnot hide the size of a process' data regions. Without virtual memory\nhardware, it is very difficult to hide a process' size, and that size is not\nparticularly sensitive.\n\nIt is often practical to build constant-time cryptographic API\nimplementations, and protecting the secrecy of plaintext is valuable. As\nsuch, it may make sense for a Tock board to expose a cryptographic API with\nsome side channel defenses.\n\n\nGuaranteed Launching of Binaries\nTock does not guarantee that binaries it finds are launched as processes. For\nexample, if there is not enough RAM available to launch every binary then the\nkernel will skip some binaries.\nThis parallels the \"first-come, first-served\" resource reservation process\ndescribed in Virtualization.\nComponents Trusted to Provide Isolation\nThe Tock kernel depends on several components (including hardware and software)\nin order to implement the above isolation guarantees. Some of these components,\nsuch as the application loader, may vary depending on Tock's use case. The\nfollowing documents describe the trust model that exists between the Tock kernel\nand its security-relevant dependencies:\n\nCapsule Isolation describes the coding practices used\nto isolate capsules from the remainder of the kernel.\n\nApplication Loader describes the trust placed in the\napplication deployment mechanism.\n\nTBF Headers describes the trust model associated with the\nTock Binary Format headers.\n\nCode Review describes code review practices used to ensure\nthe trustworthiness of Tock's codebase.\n\n\nWhat is an \"Application\"?\nTock does not currently have a precise definition of \"application\", although\nthere is consensus on the following:\n\nUnlike a process, an application persists across reboots and updates. For\nexample, an application binary can be updated without becoming a new\napplication but the update will create a new process.\n\nAn application consists of at least one application binary (in the Tock Binary\nFormat), although it is unclear whether multiple application binaries can\ncollectively be considered a single application (e.g. if they implement a\nsingle piece of functionality).\n\n\nThis section will be updated when we have a more precise definition of\n\"application\".\n"},"Lifetimes.html":{"url":"Lifetimes.html","title":"Lifetimes","keywords":"","body":"ライフタイム\nTockカーネルの値は、以下の3つの方法で割り当てることができます。\n\n静的割り当て。静的に割り当てられた値は解放されることはありません。\nこれらの値はRustでは'staticライフタイムの「借用」であると表現されます。\n\nスタック割り当て。スタック割り当てされた値はレキシカル境界のライフ\nタイムを持ちます。すなわち、ソースコードを見れば、それがいつ解放されるかがわかります。このような値への参照を作成すると、Rustの型システムは、参照に「ライフタイム」を割り当てることで、値が解放された後ではけっして参照が使用されないことを保証します。\n\nグラント値。プロセスのグラント領域から割り当てられた値は、ランタイム\n依存のライフタイムを持ちます。たとえば、それがいつ解放されるかは、プロセスがクラッシュするか否かに依存します。Rustの型システムではランタイム依存のライフタイムを表現できないため、Tockでのグラント値への参照は、参照元が所有する Grant型を介して行われます。\n\n\n次に、Rust のライフタイムの概念が Tock の値のライフタイムにどのように対応するか、また、これがカーネル内での異なるタイプの値の使用にどのように影響するかについて説明します。\nRust の寿命\nバッファ管理\n円形の依存関係\nNext we'll discuss how Rust's notion of lifetimes maps to the lifetimes of\nvalues in Tock and how this affects the use of different types of values in the\nkernel.\n\n\n\nライフタイム\nRust lifetimes\nBuffer management\nCircular dependencies\n\n\n\n\nRust lifetimes\nEach reference (called a borrow) in Rust has lifetime associated with its\ntype that determines in what scope it is valid.

For example:\nstruct Foo {\n  bar: &'a Bar\n}\n\ndefines a data structure Foo that contains a reference to another type,\nBar. The reference has a lifetime 'a, which is a type parameter of Foo.\nNote that 'a is an arbitrary choice of name for the lifetime, such as E in\na generic List.  It is also possible to use the explicit lifetime\n'static rather than a type parameter when the reference should always live\nforever, regardless of how long the containing type (e.g. Foo) lives:\nstruct Foo {\n  bar: &'static Bar\n}\n\nBuffer management\nBuffers used in asynchronous hardware operations must be static. On the one\nhand, we need to guarantee (to the hardware) that the buffer will not be\ndeallocated before the hardware relinquishes its pointer. On the other hand,\nthe hardware has no way of telling us (i.e. the Rust compiler) that it will\nonly access the buffer within a certain lexical bound (because we are using the\nhardware asynchronously). To resolve this, buffers passed to hardware should be\nallocated statically.\nCircular dependencies\nTock uses circular dependencies to give capsules access to each other.\nSpecifically, two capsules that depend on each other will each have a field\ncontaining a reference to the other. For example, a client of the timer Alarm trait\nneeds a reference to an instance of the timer in order to start/stop it, while\nthe instance of timer needs a reference to the client in order to propagate\nevents. This is handled by the set_client function, which allows the platform\ndefinition to connect objects after creation.\nimpl Foo {\n  fn set_client(&self, client: &'a Client) {\n    self.client.set(client);\n  }\n}\n\n"},"Mutable_References.html":{"url":"Mutable_References.html","title":"Mutable References","keywords":"","body":"Mutable References in Tock - Memory Containers (Cells)\nBorrows are a critical part of the Rust language that help provide its\nsafety guarantees. However, when there is no dynamic memory allocation\n(no heap), event-driven code runs into challenges with Rust's borrow\nsemantics.  Often multiple structs need to\nbe able to call (share) a struct based on what events occur. For example,\na struct representing a radio interface needs to handle callbacks\nboth from the bus it uses as well as handle calls from higher layers of\na networking stack. Both of these callers need to be able to change the\nstate of the radio struct, but Rust's borrow checker does not allow them\nto both have mutable references to the struct.\nTo solve this problem, Tock builds on the observation that having two\nreferences to a struct that can modify it is safe, as long as no references\nto memory inside the struct are leaked (there is no interior mutability).\nTock uses memory containers, a set of types that allow mutability\nbut not interior mutability, to achieve this goal. The Rust standard\nlibrary has two memory container types, Cell and RefCell. Tock uses\nCell extensively, but also adds five new memory container types, each\nof which is tailored to a specific use common in kernel code.\n\n\n\nBrief Overview of Borrowing in Rust\nIssues with Borrowing in Event-Driven code\nCells in Tock\nThe TakeCell abstraction\nExample use of take and replace\nExample use of map\nmap variants\n\n\n\n\nMapCell\nOptionalCell\nVolatileCell\nCell Extensions\nNumericCellExt\n\n\n\n\nBrief Overview of Borrowing in Rust\nOwnership and Borrowing are two design features in Rust which\nprevent race conditions and make it impossible to write code that produces\ndangling pointers.\nBorrowing is the Rust mechanism to allow references to\nmemory. Similar to references in C++ and other languages, borrows make\nit possible to efficiently pass large structures by passing pointers\nrather than copying the entire structure.  The Rust compiler, however,\nlimits borrows so that they cannot create race conditions, which are\ncaused by concurrent writes or concurrent reads and writes to\nmemory. Rust limits code to either a single mutable (writeable)\nreference or any number of read-only references.\nIf a piece of code has a mutable reference to a piece of memory, it's\nalso important that other code does not have any references within\nthat memory. Otherwise, the language is not safe. For example, consider\nthis case of an enum which can be either a pointer or a value:\nenum NumOrPointer {\n  Num(u32),\n  Pointer(&'static mut u32)\n}\n\nA Rust enum is like a type-safe C union. Suppose that code has both\na mutable reference to a NumOrPointer and a read-only reference to\nthe encapsulated Pointer. If the code with the NumOrPointer\nreference changes it to be a Num, it can then set the Num to be\nany value.  However, the reference to Pointer can still access the\nmemory as a pointer. As these two representations use the same memory,\nthis means that the reference to Num can create any pointer it\nwants, breaking Rust's type safety:\n// n.b. illegal example\nlet external : &mut NumOrPointer;\nmatch external {\n  &mut Pointer(ref mut internal) => {\n    // This would violate safety and\n    // write to memory at 0xdeadbeef\n    *external = Num(0xdeadbeef);\n    *internal = 12345;\n  },\n  ...\n}\n\nAs the Tock kernel is single\nthreaded, it doesn't have race conditions and so in some cases it may\nbe safe for there to be multiple references, as long as they do not\npoint inside each other (as in the number/pointer example).  But Rust\ndoesn't know this, so its rules still hold.  In practice, Rust's rules\ncause problems in event-driven code.\nIssues with Borrowing in Event-Driven code\nEvent-driven code often requires multiple writeable references to\nthe same object. Consider, for example, an event-driven embedded\napplication that periodically samples a sensor and receives commands\nover a serial port. At any given time, this application can have two\nor three event callbacks registered: a timer, sensor data acquisition,\nand receiving a command. Each callback is registered with a different\ncomponent in the kernel, and each of these components requires a\nreference to the object to issue a callback on. That is, the generator\nof each callback requires its own writeable reference to the\napplication. Rust's rules, however, do not allow multiple mutable\nreferences.\nCells in Tock\nTock uses several Cell types for\ndifferent data types. This\ntable summarizes the various types, and more detail is included below.\n\n\n\nCell Type\nBest Used For\nExample\nCommon Uses\n\n\n\n\nCell\nPrimitive types\nCell, sched/mod.rs\nState variables (holding an enum), true/false flags, integer parameters like length.\n\n\nTakeCell\nSmall static buffers\nTakeCell, spi.rs\nHolding static buffers that will receive or send data.\n\n\nMapCell\nLarge static buffers\nMapCell, spi.rs\nDelegating reference to large buffers (e.g. application buffers).\n\n\nOptionalCell\nOptional parameters\nclient: OptionalCell, nonvolatile_to_pages.rs\nKeeping state that can be uninitialized, like a Client before one is set.\n\n\nVolatileCell\nRegisters\nVolatileCell\nAccessing MMIO registers, used by tock_registers crate.\n\n\n\nThe TakeCell abstraction\nWhile the different memory containers each have specialized uses, most of their\noperations are common across the different types. We therefore explain the basic\nuse of memory containers in the context of TakeCell, and the additional/specialized\nfunctionality of each other type in its own section.\nFrom tock/libraries/tock-cells/src/take_cell.rs:\n\nA TakeCell is a potential reference to mutable memory. Borrow rules are\nenforced by forcing clients to either move the memory out of the cell or\noperate on a borrow within a closure.\n\nA TakeCell can be full or empty: it is like a safe pointer that can be\nnull. If code wants to operate on the data contained in the TakeCell,\nit must either move the data out of the TakeCell (making it empty), or\nit must do so within a closure with a map call. Using map passes a\nblock of code for the TakeCell to execute.  Using a closure allows\ncode to modify the contents of the TakeCell inline, without any danger\nof a control path accidentally not replacing the value. However,\nbecause it is a closure, a reference to the contents of the TakeCell\ncannot escape.\nTakeCell allows code to modify its contents when it has a normal\n(non-mutable) reference. This in turn means that if a structure\nstores its state in TakeCells, then code which has a regular\n(non-mutable) reference to the structure can change the contents\nof the TakeCell and therefore modify the structure. Therefore,\nit is possible for multiple callbacks to have references to\nthe structure and modify its state.\nExample use of take and replace\nWhen TakeCell.take() is called, ownership of a location in memory\nmoves out of the cell. It can then be freely used by whoever took it\n(as they own it) and then put back with TakeCell.put() or\nTakeCell.replace().\nFor example, this piece of code from chips/nrf51/src/clock.rs\nsets the callback client for a hardware clock:\npub fn set_client(&self, client: &'static ClockClient) {\n    self.client.replace(client);\n}\n\nIf there is a current client, it's replaced with client. If\nself.client is empty, then it's filled with client.\nThis piece of code from chips/sam4l/src/dma.rs cancels a\ncurrent direct memory access (DMA) operation, removing the\nbuffer in the current transaction from the TakeCell with a\ncall to take:\npub fn abort_transfer(&self) -> Option {\n    let registers: &DMARegisters = unsafe { &*self.registers };\n    registers.interrupt_disable.set(!0);\n    // Reset counter\n    registers.transfer_counter.set(0);\n    self.buffer.take()\n}\n\nExample use of map\nAlthough the contents of a TakeCell can be directly accessed through\na combination of take and replace, Tock code typically uses\nTakeCell.map(), which wraps the provided closure between a\nTakeCell.take() and TakeCell.replace(). This approach has the\nadvantage that a bug in control flow that doesn't correctly replace\nwon't accidentally leave the TakeCell empty.\nHere is a simple use of map, taken from chips/sam4l/src/dma.rs:\npub fn disable(&self) {\n    let registers: &SpiRegisters = unsafe { &*self.registers };\n\n    self.dma_read.map(|read| read.disable());\n    self.dma_write.map(|write| write.disable());\n    registers.cr.set(0b10);\n}\n\nBoth dma_read and dma_write are of type TakeCell,\nthat is, a TakeCell for a mutable reference to a DMA channel. By calling map,\nthe function can access the reference and call the disable function. If\nthe TakeCell has no reference (it is empty), then map does nothing.\nHere is a more complex example use of map, taken from chips/sam4l/src/spi.rs:\nself.client.map(|cb| {\n    txbuf.map(|txbuf| {\n        cb.read_write_done(txbuf, rxbuf, len);\n    });\n});\n\nIn this example, client is a TakeCell.\nThe closure passed to map has a single argument, the value which the\nTakeCell contains. So in this case, cb is the reference to an\nSpiMasterClient. Note that the closure passed to client.map then\nitself contains a closure, which uses cb to invoke a callback passing\ntxbuf.\nmap variants\nTakeCell.map() provides a convenient method for interacting with a\nTakeCell's stored contents, but it also hides the case when the TakeCell is\nempty by simply not executing the closure. To allow for handling the cases when\nthe TakeCell is empty, rust (and by extension Tock) provides additional\nfunctions.\nThe first is .map_or(). This is useful for returning a value both when the\nTakeCell is empty and when it has a contained value. For example, rather than:\nlet return = if txbuf.is_some() {\n    txbuf.map(|txbuf| {\n        write_done(txbuf);\n    });\n    ReturnCode::SUCCESS\n} else {\n    ReturnCode::ERESERVE\n};\n\n.map_or() allows us to do this instead:\nlet return = txbuf.map_or(ReturnCode::ERESERVE, |txbuf| {\n    write_done(txbuf);\n    ReturnCode::SUCCESS\n});\n\nIf the TakeCell is empty, the first argument (the error code) is returned,\notherwise the closure is executed and SUCCESS is returned.\nSometimes we may want to execute different code based on whether the TakeCell\nis empty or not. Again, we could do this:\nif txbuf.is_some() {\n    txbuf.map(|txbuf| {\n        write_done(txbuf);\n    });\n} else {\n    write_done_failure();\n};\n\nInstead, however, we can use the .map_or_else() function. This allows us to\npass in two closures, one for if the TakeCell is empty, and one for if it has\ncontents:\ntxbuf.map_or_else(|| {\n    write_done_failure();\n}, |txbuf| {\n    write_done(txbuf);\n});\n\nNote, in both the .map_or() and .map_or_else() cases, the first argument\ncorresponds to when the TakeCell is empty.\nMapCell\nA MapCell is very similar to a TakeCell in its purpose and interface.\nWhat differs is the underlying implementation. In a TakeCell, when\nsomething take()s the contents of the cell, the memory inside is actually\nmoved. This is a performance problem if the data in a TakeCell is\nlarge, but saves both cycles and memory if the data is small (like a\npointer or slice) because the internal Option can be optimized in many cases\nand the code operates on registers as opposed to memory. On the flip side,\nMapCells introduce some accounting overhead for small types and require a\nminimum number of cycles to access.\nThe commit that introduced MapCell includes some performance\nbenchmarks, but exact performance will vary based on the usage scenario.\nGenerally speaking, medium to large sized buffers should prefer MapCells.\nOptionalCell\nOptionalCell\nis effectively a wrapper for a Cell that contains an Option, like:\nCell>. This to an extent mirrors the TakeCell interface, where the\nOption is hidden from the user. So instead of my_optional_cell.get().map(||\n{}), the code can be: my_optional_cell.map(|| {}).\nOptionalCell can hold the same values that Cell can, but can also be just\nNone if the value is effectively unset. Using an OptionalCell (like a\nNumCell) makes the code clearer and hides extra tedious function calls.\nVolatileCell\nA VolatileCell is just a helper type for doing volatile reads and writes to a\nvalue. This is mostly used for accessing memory-mapped I/O registers. The\nget() and set() functions are wrappers around core::ptr::read_volatile()\nand core::ptr::write_volatile().\nCell Extensions\nIn addition to custom types, Tock adds extensions to some of\nthe standard cells to enhance and ease usability. The mechanism here is to add\ntraits to existing data types to enhance their ability. To use extensions,\nauthors need only use kernel::common::cells::THE_EXTENSION to pull the new\ntraits into scope.\nNumericCellExt\nNumericCellExt\nextends cells that contain \"numeric\" types (like usize or i32) to provide\nsome convenient functions (add() and subtract(), for example). This\nextension makes for cleaner code when storing numbers that are increased or\ndecreased. For example, with a typical Cell, adding one to the stored value\nlooks like: my_cell.set(my_cell.get() + 1). With a NumericCellExt it is a\nlittle easier to understand: my_cell.increment() (or my_cell.add(1)).\n"},"Soundness.html":{"url":"Soundness.html","title":"Soundness","keywords":"","body":"Soundness and Unsafe Issues\nAn operating system necessarily must use unsafe code. This document explains\nthe rationale behind some of the key mechanisms in Tock that do use unsafe code\nbut should still preserve safety in the overall OS.\n\n\n\nstatic_init!\nUse\nSoundness\nAlternatives\n\n\nCapabilities: Restricting Access to Certain Functions and Operations\nCapability Examples\n\n\n\n\nstatic_init!\nThe \"type\" of static_init! is basically:\nT => (fn() -> T) -> &'static mut T\n\nMeaning that given a function that returns something of type T, static_init!\nreturns a mutable reference to T with static lifetime.\nThis is effectively meant to be equivalent to declaring a mutable static\nvariable:\nstatic mut MY_VAR: SomeT = SomeT::const_constructor();\n\nThen creating a reference to it:\nlet my_ref: &'static mut = &mut MY_VAR;\n\nHowever, the rvalue in static declarations must be const (because Rust doesn't\nhave pre-initialization sections). So static_init! basically allows static\nvariables that have non-const initializers.\nNote that in both of these cases, the caller must wrap the calls in unsafe\nsince references a mutable variable is unsafe (due to aliasing rules).\nUse\nstatic_init! is used in Tock to initialize capsules, which will eventually\nreference each other. In all cases, these references are immutable. It is\nimportant for these to be statically allocated for two reasons. First, it helps\nsurface memory pressure issues at link time (if they are allocated on the stack,\nthey won't trivially show up as out-of-memory link errors if the stack isn't\nsized properly). Second, the lifetimes of mutually-dependent capsules needs to\nbe equal, and 'static is a convenient way of achieving this.\nHowever, in a few cases, it is useful to start with a mutable reference in order\nto enforce who can make certain calls. For example, setting up buffers in the\nSPI driver is, for practical reasons, deferred until after construction but we\nwould like to enforce that it can only be called by the platform initialization\nfunction (before main starts). This is enforced because all references after\nthe platform is setup are immutable, and the config_buffers method takes an\n&mut self (Note: it looks like this is not strictly necessary, so maybe not a\nbig deal if we can't do this).\nSoundness\nThe thing that would make the use of static_init! unsafe is if it was used to\ncreate aliases to mutable references. The fact that it returns an &'static mut\nis a red flag, so it bears explanation why I think this is OK.\nJust as with any &mut, as soon as it is reborrowed it can no longer be used.\nWhat we do in Tock, specifically, is use it mutably in some cases immediately\nafter calling static_init!, then reborrow it immutably to pass into capsules.\nIf a particular capsule happened to treat accept an &mut, the compiler would\ntry to move the reference and it would either fail that call (if it's already\nreborrowed immutably elsewhere) or disallow further reborrows. Note that this is\nfine if it is indeed not used as a shared reference (although I don't think we\nhave examples of that use).\nIt is important, though, that the same code calling static_init! is not\nexecuted twice. This creates two major issues. First, it could technically\nresult in multiple mutable references. Second, it would run the constructor\ntwice, which may create other soundness or functional issues with existing\nreferences to the same memory. I believe this is not different that code that\ntakes a mutable reference to a static variable. Again, importantly both cases\nmust be wrapped with unsafe.\nAlternatives\nIt seems technically possible to return an immutable static reference from\nstatic_init! instead. It would require a bit of code changes, and wouldn't\nallow us to restrict certain capsule methods to initialization, but may not be a\nparticularly big deal.\nAlso, something something static variables of type Option everywhere (ugh...\nbut maybe reasonable).\nCapabilities: Restricting Access to Certain Functions and Operations\nCertain operations and functions, particularly those in the kernel crate, are\nnot \"unsafe\" from a language perspective, but are unsafe from an isolation and\nsystem operation perspective. For example, restarting a process, conceptually,\ndoes not violate type or memory safety (even though the specific implementation\nin Tock does), but it would violate overall system safety if any code in the\nkernel could restart any arbitrary process. Therefore, Tock must be careful with\nhow it provides a function like restart_process(), and, in particular, must\nnot allow capsules, which are untrusted code that must be sandboxed by Rust, to\nhave access to the restart_process() function.\nLuckily, Rust provides a primitive for doing this restriction: use of the\nunsafe keyword. Any function marked as unsafe can only be called from a\ndifferent unsafe function or from an unsafe block. Therefore, by removing\nthe ability to define an unsafe block, using the #![forbid(unsafe_code)]\nattribute in a crate, all modules in that crate cannot call any functions marked\nwith unsafe. In the case of Tock, the capsules crate is marked with this\nattribute, and therefore all capsules cannot use unsafe functions. While this\napproach is effective, it is very coarse-grained: it provides either access to\nall unsafe functions or none. To provide more nuanced control, Tock includes\na mechanism called Capabilities.\nCapabilities are essentially zero-memory objects that are required to call\ncertain functions. Abstractly, restricted functions, like restart_process(),\nwould require that the caller has a certain capability:\nrestart_process(process_id: usize, capability: ProcessRestartCapability) {}\nAny attempt to call that function without possessing that capability would\nresult in code that does not compile. To prevent unauthorized uses of\ncapabilities, capabilities can only be created by trusted code. In Tock, this is\nimplemented by defining capabilities as unsafe traits, which can only be\nimplemented for an object by code capable of calling unsafe. Therefore, code\nin the untrusted capsules crate cannot generate a capability on its own, and\ninstead must be passed the capability by module in a different crate.\nCapabilities can be defined for very broad purposes or very narrowly, and code\ncan \"request\" multiple capabilities. Multiple capabilities in Tock can be passed\nby implementing multiple capability traits for a single object.\nCapability Examples\n\nOne example of how capabilities are useful in Tock is with loading processes.\nLoading processes is left as a responsibility of the board, since a board may\nchoose to handle its processes in a certain way, or not support userland\nprocesses at all. However, the kernel crate provides a helpful function\ncalled load_processes() that provides the Tock standard method for finding\nand loading processes. This function is defined in the kernel crate so that\nall Tock boards can share it, which necessitates that the function be made\npublic. This has the effect that all modules with access to the kernel\ncrate can call load_processes(), even though calling it twice would lead to\nunwanted behavior. One approach is to mark the function as unsafe, so only\ntrusted code can call it. This is effective, but not explicit, and conflates\nlanguage-level safety with system operation-level safety. By instead\nrequiring that the caller of load_processes() has a certain capability, the\nexpectations of the caller are more explicit, and the unsafe function does\nnot have to be repurposed.\n\nA similar example is a function like restart_all_processes() which causes\nall processes on the board to enter a fault state and restart from their\noriginal _start point with all grants removed. Again, this is a function\nthat could violate the system-level goals, but could be very useful in\ncertain situations or for debugging grant cleanup when apps fail. Unlike\nload_processes(), however, it might make sense for a capsule to be able to\ncall restart_all_processes(), in response to a certain event or to act as a\nwatchdog. In that case, restricting access by marking it as unsafe will not\nwork: capsules cannot call unsafe code. By using capabilities, only a caller\nwith the correct capability can call restart_all_processes(), and\nindividual boards can be very explicit about which capsules they grant which\ncapabilities.\n\n\n"},"Compilation.html":{"url":"Compilation.html","title":"Compilation","keywords":"","body":"How does Tock compile?\nThere are two types of compilation artifacts in Tock: the kernel and user-level\nprocesses (i.e. apps). Each type compiles differently. In addition, each\nplatform has a different way of programming the kernel and processes. Below is\nan explanation of both kernel and process compilation as well as some examples\nof how platforms program each onto an actual board.\n\n\n\nCompiling the kernel\nLife of a Tock compilation\nLLVM Binutils\nSpecial .apps section\n\n\nCompiling a process\nPosition Independent Code\nTock Binary Format\nTock Application Bundle\nTAB Format\nMetadata\n\n\n\n\nLoading the kernel and processes onto a board\n\n\nCompiling the kernel\nThe kernel is divided into five Rust crates (i.e. packages):\n\nA core kernel crate containing key kernel operations such as handling\ninterrupts and scheduling processes, shared kernel libraries such as\nTakeCell, and the Hardware Interface Layer (HIL) definitions. This is\nlocated in the kernel/ folder.\n\nAn architecture (e.g. ARM Cortex M4) crate that implements context\nswitching, and provides memory protection and systick drivers. This is\nlocated in the arch/ folder.\n\nA chip-specific (e.g. Atmel SAM4L) crate which handles interrupts and\nimplements the hardware abstraction layer for a chip's peripherals. This is\nlocated in the chips/ folder.\n\nOne (or more) crates for hardware independent drivers and virtualization\nlayers. This is the capsules/ folder in Tock. External projects using\nTock may create additional crates for their own drivers.\n\nA platform specific (e.g. Imix) crate that configures the chip and\nits peripherals, assigns peripherals to drivers, sets up virtualization\nlayers, and defines a system call interface. This is located in boards/.\n\n\nThese crates are compiled using Cargo, Rust's package\nmanager, with the platform crate as the base of the dependency graph. In\npractice, the use of Cargo is masked by the Makefile system in Tock. Users can\nsimply type make from the proper directory in boards/ to build the kernel\nfor that platform.\nInternally, the Makefile is simply invoking Cargo to handle the build. For\nexample, make on the imix platform translates to:\n$ cargo build --release --target=thumbv7em-none-eabi\n\nThe --release argument tells Cargo to invoke the Rust compiler with\noptimizations turned on. --target points Cargo to the target specification\nwhich includes the LLVM data-layout definition and architecture definitions for\nthe compiler.\nLife of a Tock compilation\nWhen Cargo begins compiling the platform crate, it first resolves all\ndependencies recursively. It chooses package versions that satisfy the\nrequirements across the dependency graph. Dependencies are defined in each\ncrate's Cargo.toml file and refer to paths in the local file-system, a\nremote git repository, or a package published on crates.io.\nSecond, Cargo compiles each crate in turn as dependencies are satisfied. Each\ncrate is compiled as an rlib (an ar archive containing object files)\nand combined into an executable ELF file by the compilation of the platform\ncrate.\nYou can see each command executed by cargo by passing it the --verbose\nargument. In our build system, you can run make V=1 to see the verbose\ncommands.\nLLVM Binutils\nTock uses the lld, objcopy, and size tools included with the Rust\ntoolchain to produce kernel binaries that are executed on microcontrollers. This\nhas three main ramifications:\n\nThe tools are not entirely feature-compatible with the GNU versions. While\nthey are very similar, there are edge cases where they do not behave exactly\nthe same. This will likely improve with time, but it is worth noting in case\nunexpected issues arise.\nThe tools will automatically update with Rust versions. The tools are\nprovided in the llvm-tools rustup component that is compiled for and ships\nwith every version of the Rust toolchain. Therefore, if Rust updates the\nversion they use in the Rust repository, Tock will also see those updates.\nTock no longer relies on an external dependency to provide these tools. That\nshould ensure that all Tock developers are using the same version of the\ntools.\n\nSpecial .apps section\nTock kernels include a .apps section in the kernel .elf file that is at the\nsame physical address where applications will be loaded. When compiling the\nkernel, this is just a placeholder and is not populated with any meaningful\ndata. It exists to make it easy to update the kernel .elf file with an\napplication binary to make a monolithic .elf file so that the kernel and apps\ncan be flashed together.\nWhen the Tock build system creates the kernel binary, it explicitly removes this\nsection so that the placeholder is not included in the kernel binary.\nTo use the special .apps section, objcopy can replace the placeholder with an actual app binary. The general command looks like:\n$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy --update-section .apps=libtock-c/examples/c_hello/build/cortex-m4/cortex-m4.tbf target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/release/stm32f412gdiscovery.elf target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/release/stm32f4discovery-app.elf\n\nThis replaces the placeholder section .apps with the \"c_hello\" application TBF\nin the stm32f412gdiscovery.elf kernel ELF, and creates a new .elf called\nstm32f4discovery-app.elf.\nCompiling a process\nUnlike many other embedded systems, compilation of application code is entirely\nseparated from the kernel in Tock. An application is combined with at least two\nlibraries: libtock and newlib and built into a free-standing binary. The\nbinary can then be uploaded onto a Tock platform with an already existing\nkernel to be loaded and run.\nTock can support any programming language and compiler provided they meet\nthe following requirements:\n\nThe application must be built as position independent code (PIC).\n\nThe application must be linked with a loader script that places Flash\ncontents above address 0x80000000 and RAM contents below it.\n\nThe application binary must start with a header detailing the location of\nsections in the binary.\n\n\nThe first requirement is explained directly below while the other two are\ndetailed in Tock Binary Format.\nPosition Independent Code\nSince Tock loads applications separately from the kernel and is capable of\nrunning multiple applications concurrently, applications cannot know in advance\nat which address they will be loaded. This problem is common to many computer\nsystems and is typically addressed by dynamically linking and loading code at\nruntime.\nTock, however, makes a different choice and requires applications to be compiled\nas position independent code. Compiling with PIC makes all control flow relative\nto the current PC, rather than using jumps to specified absolute addresses. All\ndata accesses are relative to the start of the data segment for that app, and\nthe address of the data segment is stored in a register referred to as the base\nregister. This allows the segments in Flash and RAM to be placed anywhere, and\nthe OS only has to correctly initialize the base register.\nPIC code can be inefficient on some architectures such as x86, but the ARM\ninstruction set is optimized for PIC operation and allows most code to execute\nwith little to no overhead. Using PIC still requires some fixup at runtime, but\nthe relocations are simple and cause only a one-time cost when an application\nis loaded.  A more in-depth discussion of dynamically loading applications can\nbe found on the Tock website: Dynamic Code Loading on a\nMCU.\nFor applications compiled with arm-none-eabi-gcc, building PIC code for Tock\nrequires four flags:\n\n-fPIC: only emit code that uses relative addresses.\n-msingle-pic-base: force the use of a consistent base register for the\ndata sections.\n-mpic-register=r9: use register r9 as the base register.\n-mno-pic-data-is-text-relative: do not assume that the data segment is\nplaced at a constant offset from the text segment.\n\nEach Tock application uses a linker script that places Flash at address\n0x80000000 and SRAM at address 0x00000000. This allows relocations pointing\nat Flash to be easily differentiated from relocations pointing at RAM.\nTock Binary Format\nIn order to be loaded correctly, applications must follow the Tock Binary\nFormat. This means the initial bytes of a Tock app must\nfollow this format so that Tock can load the application correctly.\nIn practice, this is automatically handled for applications. As part of the\ncompilation process, a tool called Elf to TAB\ndoes the conversion from ELF to Tock's expected binary format, ensuring that\nsections are placed in the expected order, adding a section that lists necessary\nload-time relocations, and creating the TBF header.\nTock Application Bundle\nTo support ease-of-use and distributable applications, Tock applications are\ncompiled for multiple architectures and bundled together into a \"Tock\nApplication Bundle\" or .tab file. This creates a standalone file for an\napplication that can be flashed onto any board that supports Tock, and removes\nthe need for the board to be specified when the application is compiled.\nThe TAB has enough information to be flashed on many or all Tock compatible\nboards, and the correct binary is chosen when the application is flashed\nand not when it is compiled.\nTAB Format\n.tab files are tared archives of TBF compatible binaries along with a\nmetadata.toml file that includes some extra information about the application.\nA simplified example command that creates a .tab file is:\ntar cf app.tab cortex-m0.bin cortex-m4.bin metadata.toml\n\nMetadata\nThe metadata.toml file in the .tab file is a TOML file that contains a\nseries of key-value pairs, one per line, that provides more detailed information\nand can help when flashing the application. Existing fields:\ntab-version = 1                         // TAB file format version\nname = \"\"                 // Package name of the application\nonly-for-boards =       // Optional list of board kernels that this application supports\nbuild-date = 2017-03-20T19:37:11Z       // When the application was compiled\nLoading the kernel and processes onto a board\nThere is no particular limitation on how code can be loaded onto a board. JTAG\nand various bootloaders are all equally possible. For example, the hail and\nimix platforms primarily use the serial \"tock-bootloader\", and the other\nplatforms use jlink or openocd to flash code over a JTAG connection. In general,\nthese methods are subject to change based on whatever is easiest for users of\nthe platform.\nIn order to support multiple concurrent applications, the easiest option is to\nuse tockloader (git repo) to\nmanage multiple applications on a platform. Importantly, while applications\ncurrently share the same upload process as the kernel, they are planned to\nsupport additional methods in the future. Application loading through wireless\nmethods especially is targeted for future editions of Tock.\n"},"TockBinaryFormat.html":{"url":"TockBinaryFormat.html","title":"Tock Binary

have\nnon-volatile flash memory (for code) and RAM (for stack and data) in a single\naddress space. While the Cortex-M architecture specifies a high-level layout of\nthe address space, the exact layout of Tock can differ from board to board.\nMost boards simply define the beginning and end of flash and SRAM in their\nlayout.ld file and then include the generic Tock memory\nmap.\nFlash\nThe nonvolatile flash memory holds the kernel code and a linked-list of sorts\nof process code.\nKernel code\nThe kernel code is split into two major regions. The first is .text, which\nholds the vector table, program code, initialization routines, and other\nread-only data.  This section is written to the beginning of flash.\nThe second major region following up the .text region is the .relocate\nregion.  It holds values that need to exist in SRAM, but have non-zero initial\nvalues that Tock copies from flash to SRAM as part of its initialization (see\nStartup).\nProcess code\nProcesses are placed in flash starting at a known address which can be\nretrieved in the kernel using the symbol _sapps. Each process starts with a\nTock Binary Format (TBF) header and then the actual application binary.\nProcesses are placed continuously in flash, and each process's TBF header\nincludes the entire size of the process in flash. This creates a linked-list\nstructure that the kernel uses to traverse apps. The end of the valid processes\nare denoted by an invalid TBF header. Typically the flash page after the last\nvalid process is set to all 0x00 or 0xFF.\nRAM\nThe RAM holds the data currently being used by both the kernel and processes.\nKernel RAM\nThe kernel RAM contains three major regions:\n\nKernel stack.\nKernel data: initialized memory, copied from flash at boot.\nKernel BSS: uninitialized memory, zeroed at boot.\n\nProcess RAM\nThe process RAM is memory space divided between all running apps.\nA process's RAM contains four major regions:\n\nProcess stack\nProcess data\nProcess heap\nGrant\n\nThe figure below shows the memory space of one process.\n\nHardware Implementations\nSAM4L\nThe SAM4L is a microcontroller used on the Hail and Imix platforms, among\nothers.

Before reading this, make sure you\nhave a good understanding of the design of Tock and the Tock\nmemory layout.\n\n\n\nProcess Isolation\nFlash\nRAM\n\n\n\n\nMemory isolation is a key property of Tock. Without it, processes could just\naccess any part of memory, and the security of the entire system would be\ncompromised. The reason for this is that although Rust preserves memory safety (e.g. no double frees or\nbuffer overflows) and type safety at compile-time, this doesn't prevent\nprocesses, which can be written in any language, from accessing certain\naddresses which they should not have access to in memory. Some other component\nis necessary to prevent this from happening, or systems can not safely support\nuntrusted processes.\nTo support untrusted applications, Tock uses the memory protection units (MPU)\nprovided by many embedded microcontrollers. The MPU is a hardware component\nwhich can configure access permissions for certain memory regions. Three\nfundamental access types can be set for these memory regions: read (R), write\n(W) and execute (X). Full access implies all three access types are allowed in a\ncertain memory region.\nSince processes are by default not allowed to access each others' memory, the MPU\nhas to be configured for each process based on where that process is in flash\nand what memory it has allocated to it. The MPU configuration is hence\ndifferent for each process. Therefore, with each context switch to a userland\nprocess, Tock reconfigures the MPU for that process.\nWhen the system is executing kernel code, the MPU is disabled. This means there\nare no hardware restrictions preventing the kernel from accessing the entire\naddress space. Instead, what the kernel can do is restricted by the\nRust type system. For example, a capsule (which cannot use unsafe) cannot access\na process's memory because it cannot create and dereference an arbitrary\npointer. In general, Tock tries to minimize the amount of trusted code (i.e.\ncode that can call unsafe), and tries to encapsulate code that does need\nunsafe to make it clear what that code does and how to use it in a manner that\ndoes not violate overall system safety.\nProcess Isolation\nFrom an architecture perspective, processes are considered to be arbitrary code\nthat may be buggy or even malicious. Therefore, Tock takes care to ensure that\nmisbehaving applications do not compromise the integrity of the overall system.\nFlash\nFlash is the nonvolatile memory space on a microcontroller. Generally, processes\ncannot access arbitrary addresses in flash, and are certainly prohibited from\naccessing bootloader or kernel code. They are also prohibited from reading or\nwriting the nonvolatile regions of other processes.\nProcesses do have access to their own memory in flash. Certain regions,\nincluding their Tock Binary Format (TBF) header and a protected region after the\nheader, are read-only, as the kernel must be able to ensure the integrity of the\nheader. In particular, the kernel needs to know the total size of the app to find\nthe next app in flash. The kernel may also wish to store nonvolatile information\nabout the app (e.g. how many times it has entered a failure state) that the app\nshould not be able to alter.\nThe remainder of the app, and in particular the actual code of the app, is\nconsidered to be owned by the app. The app can read the flash to execute its own\ncode. If the MCU uses flash for its nonvolatile memory the app can not likely\ndirectly modify its own flash region, as flash typically requires some hardware\nperipheral interaction to erase or write flash. In this case, the app would\nrequire kernel support to modify its flash region.\nRAM\nProcess RAM is memory space divided between all running apps. The figure below\nshows the memory space of a process.\n\nA process has full access to a portion of its own RAM region. A segment of the\nRAM region, called the grant region, is reserved for use only by the kernel on\nbehalf of the process. Because it contains kernel data structures, processes\ncannot read or write the grant region.\nThe remainder of the process's memory region can be used as the process sees\nfit, likely for a stack, heap, and data section. The process entirely controls\nhow these are used. There are mem syscalls that the process can use to inform\nthe kernel of where it has placed its stack and heap, but these are entirely\nused for debugging. The kernel does not need to know how the process has\norganized its memory for normal operation.\nProcesses can choose to explicitly share portions of their RAM with the kernel\nthrough the use of allow syscalls. This gives capsules read/write access to\nthe process's memory for use with a specific capsule operation.\nProcesses can communicate with each other through an inter-process\ncommunication (IPC) mechanism.\nTo use IPC, processes specify a buffer in their RAM to use as a shared buffer,\nand then notify the kernel that they would like to share this buffer with other\nprocesses. Then, other users of this IPC mechanism are allowed to read and write\nthis buffer. Outside of IPC, a process is never able to read or write other\nprocesses' RAM.\n"},"Registers.html":{"url":"Registers.html","title":"Registers","keywords":"","body":"Tock Register Interface\nThis crate provides an interface for defining and manipulating memory mapped\nregisters and bitfields.\nDefining registers\nThe crate provides three types for working with memory mapped registers:\nReadWrite, ReadOnly, and WriteOnly, providing read-write, read-only, and\nwrite-only functionality, respectively.\nDefining the registers is done with the register_structs macro, which expects\nfor each register an offset, a field name, and a type.

The unit tests make sure that the offsets and\npadding are consistent with the actual fields in the struct, and that alignment\nis correct.\nSince those tests would break compilation in custom-test-frameworks\nenvironments, it is possible to opt out of the test generation.

Thus, you are ensured that a single call will set or query all\nfields simultaneously.\nPerformance\nExamining the binaries while testing this interface, everything compiles\ndown to the optimal inlined bit twiddling instructions--in other words, there is\nzero runtime cost, as far as an informal preliminary study has found.\nNice type checking\nThis interface helps the compiler catch some common types of bugs via type checking.\nIf you define the bitfields for e.g. a control register, you can give them a\ndescriptive group name like Control. This group of bitfields will only work\nwith a register of the type ReadWrite (or ReadOnly/WriteOnly,\netc). For instance, if we have the bitfields and registers as defined above,\n// This line compiles, because registers.cr is associated with the Control group\n// of bitfields.\nregisters.cr.modify(Control::RANGE.val(1));\n\n// This line will not compile, because registers.s is associated with the Status\n// group, not the Control group.\nlet range = registers.s.read(Control::RANGE);\n\nNaming conventions\nThere are several related names in the register definitions. Below is a\ndescription of the naming convention for each:\nuse tock_registers::registers::ReadWrite;\n\n#[repr(C)]\nstruct Registers {\n    // The register name in the struct should be a lowercase version of the\n    // register abbreviation, as written in the datasheet:\n    cr: ReadWrite,\n}\n\nregister_bitfields!

The location of the vector table in memory is chip-specific,\nthus it is placed in a special section for linking.\nCortex-M microcontrollers expect a vector table to be at address 0x00000000.\nThis can either be a software bootloader or the Tock kernel itself.\nRISC-V gives hardware designers a great deal of design freedom for how\nbooting works. Typically, after coming out of reset, a RISC-V processor\nwill start executing out of ROM but this may be configurable. The HiFive1\nboard, for example, supports booting out ROM, One-Time programmable (OTP)\nmemory or a QSPI flash controller.\nOptional Bootloader\nMany Tock boards (including Hail and imix) use a software bootloader that\nexecutes when the MCU first boots. The bootloader provides a way to talk to the\nchip over serial and to load new code, as well as potentially other\nadministrative tasks. When the bootloader has finished, it tells the MCU that\nthe vector table has moved (to a known address), and then jumps to a new\naddress.\nTock first instructions\nARM Vector Table and IRQ table\nOn ARM chips, Tock splits the vector table into two sections, .vectors which\nhold the first 16 entries, common to all ARM cores, and .irqs, which is\nappended to the end and holds chip-specific interrupts.\nIn the source code then, the vector table will appear as an array that is\nmarked to be placed into the .vectors section.\nIn Rust, a vector table will look something like this:\n#[link_section=\".vectors\"]\n#[used] // Ensures that the symbol is kept until the final binary\npub static BASE_VECTORS: [unsafe extern fn(); 16] = [\n    _estack,                        // Initial stack pointer value\n    tock_kernel_reset_handler,      // Tock's reset handler function\n    /* NMI */ unhandled_interrupt,  // Generic handler function\n    ...\n\nIn C, a vector table will look something like this:\n__attribute__ ((section(\".vectors\")))\ninterrupt_function_t interrupt_table[] = {\n        (interrupt_function_t) (&_estack),\n        tock_kernel_reset_handler,\n        NMI_Handler,\n\nAt the time of this writing (November 2018), typical chips (like the sam4l and\nnrf52) use the same handler for all interrupts, and look something like:\n#[link_section = \".vectors\"]\n#[used] // Ensures that the symbol is kept until the final binary\npub static IRQS: [unsafe extern \"C\" fn(); 80] = [generic_isr; 80];\n\nRISC-V\nAll RISC-V boards are linked to run the _start function as the first\nfunction that gets run before jumping to reset_handler. This is currently\ninline assembly as of this writing:\n#[cfg(all(target_arch = \"riscv32\", target_os = \"none\"))]\n#[link_section = \".riscv.start\"]\n#[export_name = \"_start\"]\n#[naked]\npub extern \"C\" fn _start() {\n    unsafe {\n        asm! (\"\n\nReset Handler\nOn boot, the MCU calls the reset handler function defined in vector\ntable. In Tock, the implementation of the reset handler function is\nplatform-specific and defined in boards//src/main.rs for each\nboard.\nMemory Initialization\nThe first operation the reset handler does is setup the kernel's memory by\ncopying it from flash. For the SAM4L, this is in the init() function in\nchips/sam4l/src/lib.rs.\nRISC-V Trap setup\nThe mtvec register needs to be set on RISC-V to handle traps. Setting\nof the vectors is handled by chip specific functions. The common RISC-V trap\nhandler is _start_trap, defined in arch/rv32i/src/lib.rs. \nMCU Setup\nAny normal MCU initialization is typically handled next. This includes\nthings like enabling the correct clocks or setting up DMA channels.\nPeripheral and Capsule Initialization\nAfter the MCU is set up, reset_handler initializes peripherals and\ncapsules. Peripherals are on-chip subsystems, such as UARTs, ADCs, and\nSPI buses; they are chip-specific code that read and write\nmemory-mapped I/O registers and are found in the corresponding chips\ndirectory. While peripherals are chip-specific implementations, they\ntypically provide hardware-independent traits, called hardware\nindependent layer (HIL) traits, found in kernel/src/hil.\nCapsules are software abstractions and services; they are\nchip-independent and found in the capsules directory. For example,\non the imix and hail platforms, the SAM4L SPI peripheral is\nimplemented in chips/sam4l/src/spi.rs, while the capsule that\nvirtualizes the SPI so multiple capsules can share it is in\ncapsules/src/virtual_spi.rs.  This virtualizer can be\nchip-independent because the chip-specific code implements the SPI HIL\n(kernel/src/hil/spi.rs). The capsule that implements a system call\nAPI to the SPI for processes is in capsules/src/spi.rs.\nBoards that initialize many peripherals and capsules use the Component\ntrait to encapsulate this complexity from reset_handler. The Component\ntrait (kernel/src/component.rs) encapsulates any initialization a\nparticular peripheral, capsule, or set of capsules need inside a\ncall to the function finalize(). Changing what the build of the kernel\nincludes involve changing just which Components are initialized, rather\nthan changing many lines of reset_handler. Components are typically\nfound in the components crate in the /boards folder, but may also be\nboard-specifc and found inside a components subdirectory of the board\ndirectory, e.g. boards/imix/src/imix_components.\nApplication Startup\nOnce the kernel components have been setup and initialized, the applications\nmust be loaded. This procedure essentially iterates over the processes stored in\nflash, extracts and validates their Tock Binary Format header, and adds them to\nan internal array of process structs.\nAn example version of this loop is in kernel/src/process.rs as the\nload_processes() function. After setting up pointers, it tries to create a\nprocess from the starting address in flash and with a given amount of memory\nremaining. If the header is validated, it tries to load the process into memory\nand initialize all of the bookkeeping in the kernel associated with the process.\nThis can fail if the process needs more memory than is available on the chip. If\nthe process is successfully loaded the kernel importantly notes the address of\nthe application's entry function which is called when the process is started.\nThe load process loop ends when the kernel runs out of statically allocated\nmemory to store processes in, available RAM for processes, or there is an\ninvalid TBF header in flash.\nScheduler Execution\nTock provides a Scheduler trait that serves as an abstraction to allow for\nplugging in different scheduling algorithms. Schedulers should be initialized\nat the end of the reset handler.\nThe final thing that the reset handler must do is call kernel.kernel_loop().\nThis starts the Tock scheduler and the main operation of the kernel.\n"},"Syscalls.html":{"url":"Syscalls.html","title":"Syscalls","keywords":"","body":"Syscalls\nThis document explains how system\ncalls work in Tock with regards\nto both the kernel and applications.

Rather than directly calling a function in the kernel, applications\ntrigger a service call (svc) interrupt which causes a context switch to the\nkernel. The kernel then uses the values in registers and the stack at the time\nof the interrupt call to determine how to route the system call and which\ndriver function to call with which data values.\nUsing system calls has three advantages. First, the act of triggering a service\ncall interrupt can be used to change the processor state. Rather than being in\nunprivileged mode (as applications are run) and limited by the Memory\nProtection Unit (MPU), after the service call the kernel switches to privileged\nmode where it has full control of system resources (more detail on ARM\nprocessor\nmodes).\nSecond, context switching to the kernel allows it to do other resource handling\nbefore returning to the application. This could include running other\napplications, servicing queued callbacks, or many other activities. Finally,\nand most importantly, using system calls allows applications to be built\nindependently from the kernel. The entire codebase of the kernel could change,\nbut as long as the system call interface remains identical, applications do not\neven need to be recompiled to work on the platform. Applications, when\nseparated from the kernel, no longer need to be loaded at the same time as the\nkernel. They could be uploaded at a later time, modified, and then have a new\nversion uploaded, all without modifying the kernel running on a platform.\nProcess State\nIn Tock, a process can be in one of three states:\n\nRunning: Normal operation. A Running process is eligible to be scheduled\nfor execution, although is subject to being paused by Tock to allow interrupt\nhandlers or other processes to run. During normal operation, a process remains\nin the Running state until it explicitly yields. Callbacks from other kernel\noperations are not delivered to Running processes (i.e. callbacks do not\ninterrupt processes), rather they are enqueued until the process yields.\nYielded: Suspended operation. A Yielded process will not be scheduled by\nTock. Processes often yield while they are waiting for I/O or other operations\nto complete and have no immediately useful work to do. Whenever the kernel issues\na callback to a Yielded process, the process is transitioned to the Running state.\nFault: Erroneous operation. A Fault-ed process will not be scheduled by\nTock. Processes enter the Fault state by performing an illegal operation, such\nas accessing memory outside of their address space.\n\nStartup\nUpon process initialization, a single function call task is added to its\ncallback queue. The function is determined by the ENTRY point in the process\nTBF header (typically the _start symbol) and is passed the following\narguments in registers r0 - r3:\n\nr0: the base address of the process code\nr1: the base address of the processes allocated memory region\nr2: the total amount of memory in its region\nr3: the current process memory break\n\nThe System Calls\nAll system calls except Yield (which cannot fail) return an integer return code\nvalue to userspace. Negative return codes indicate an error. Values greater\nthan or equal to zero indicate success. Sometimes syscall return values encode\nuseful data, for example in the gpio driver, the command for reading the\nvalue of a pin returns 0 or 1 based on the status of the pin.\nCurrently, the following return codes are defined, also available as #defines\nin C from the tock.h header (prepended with TOCK_):\npub enum ReturnCode {\n    SuccessWithValue { value: usize }, // Success value must be >= 0\n    SUCCESS,\n    FAIL, //.......... Generic failure condition\n    EBUSY, //......... Underlying system is busy; retry\n    EALREADY, //...... The state requested is already set\n    EOFF, //.......... The component is powered down\n    ERESERVE, //...... Reservation required before use\n    EINVAL, //........ An invalid parameter was passed\n    ESIZE, //......... Parameter passed was too large\n    ECANCEL, //....... Operation cancelled by a call\n    ENOMEM, //........ Memory required not available\n    ENOSUPPORT, //.... Operation or command is unsupported\n    ENODEVICE, //..... Device does not exist\n    EUNINSTALLED, //.. Device is not physically installed\n    ENOACK, //........ Packet transmission not acknowledged\n}\n\n0: Yield\nYield transitions the current process from the Running to the Yielded state, and\nthe process will not execute again until another callback re-schedules the\nprocess.\nIf a process has enqueued callbacks waiting to execute when Yield is called, the\nprocess immediately re-enters the Running state and the first callback runs, unless\nthe scheduler chooses to prioritize some other operation first.\nyield()\n\nArguments\nNone.\nReturn\nNone.\n1: Subscribe\nSubscribe assigns callback functions to be executed in response to various\nevents.\nA callback function is uniquely identified by the pair (driver,\nsubscribe_number), a.k.a. callback ID. When calling subscribe, if there\nare any pending callbacks for this callback ID, they are removed from the queue\nbefore the new callback function is bound to the callback ID.\nA process can pass a null pointer as the callback argument to request the driver\ndisable a previously set callback (besides flushing pending callbacks for this\ncallback ID).\nsubscribe(driver: u32, subscribe_number: u32, callback: u32, userdata: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32\n\nArguments\n\ndriver: An integer specifying which driver to call.\nsubscribe_number: An integer index for which function is being subscribed.\ncallback: A pointer to a callback function to be executed when this event\noccurs. All callbacks conform to the C-style function signature:\nvoid callback(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, void* data).\nuserdata: A pointer to a value of any type that will be passed back by the\nkernel as the last argument to callback.\n\nIndividual drivers define a mapping for subscribe_number to the events that\nmay generate that callback as well as the meaning for each of the callback\narguments.\nReturn\n\nENODEVICE if driver does not refer to a valid kernel driver.\nENOSUPPORT if the driver exists but doesn't support the subscribe_number.\nOther return codes based on the specific driver.\n\n2: Command\nCommand instructs the driver to perform a specific action.\ncommand(driver: u32, command_number: u32, argument1: u32, argument2: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32\n\nArguments\n\ndriver: An integer specifying which driver to call.\ncommand_number: An integer specifying the requested command.\nargument1: A command-specific argument.\nargument2: A command-specific argument.\n\nThe command_number tells the driver which command was called from\nuserspace, and the arguments are specific to the driver and command number.\nOne example of the argument being used is in the led driver, where the\ncommand to turn on an LED uses the argument to specify which LED.\nOne Tock convention with the Command syscall is that command number 0 will\nalways return a value of 0 or greater if the driver is supported by the running\nkernel. This means that any application can call command number 0 on any driver\nnumber to determine if the driver is present and the related functionality is\nsupported. In most cases this command number will return 0, indicating that the\ndriver is present. In other cases, however, the return value can have an\nadditional meaning such as the number of devices present, as is the case in the\nled driver to indicate how many LEDs are present on the board.\nReturn\n\nENODEVICE if driver does not refer to a valid kernel driver.\nENOSUPPORT if the driver exists but doesn't support the command_number.\nOther return codes based on the specific driver.\n\n3: Allow\nAllow marks a region of memory as shared between the kernel and application.\nPassing a null pointer requests the corresponding driver to stop accessing the\nshared memory region.\nallow(driver: u32, allow_number: u32, pointer: usize, size: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32\n\nArguments\n\ndriver: An integer specifying which driver should be granted access.\nallow_number: A driver-specific integer specifying the purpose of this\nbuffer.\npointer: A pointer to the start of the buffer in the process memory space.\nsize: An integer number of bytes specifying the length of the buffer.\n\nMany driver commands require that buffers are Allow-ed before they can execute.\nA buffer that has been Allow-ed does not need to be Allow-ed to be used again.\nAs of this writing, most Tock drivers do not provide multiple virtual devices to\neach application. If one application needs multiple users of a driver (i.e. two\nlibraries on top of I2C), each library will need to re-Allow its buffers before\nbeginning operations.\nReturn\n\nENODEVICE if driver does not refer to a valid kernel driver.\nENOSUPPORT if the driver exists but doesn't support the allow_number.\nEINVAL the buffer referred to by pointer and size lies completely or\npartially outside of the processes addressable RAM.\nOther return codes based on the specific driver.\n\n4: Memop\nMemop expands the memory segment available to the process, allows the process to\nretrieve pointers to its allocated memory space, provides a mechanism for\nthe process to tell the kernel where its stack and heap start, and other\noperations involving process memory.\nmemop(op_type: u32, argument: u32) -> [[ VARIES ]] as u32\n\nArguments\n\nop_type: An integer indicating whether this is a brk (0), a sbrk (1),\nor another memop call.\nargument: The argument to brk, sbrk, or other call.\n\nEach memop operation is specific and details of each call can be found in\nthe memop syscall documentation.\nReturn\n\nDependent on the particular memop call.\n\nThe Context Switch\nHandling a context switch is one of the few pieces of Tock code that is\nactually architecture dependent and not just chip-specific. The code is located\nin lib.rs within the arch/ folder under the appropriate architecture. As\nthis code deals with low-level functionality in the processor it is written in\nassembly wrapped as Rust function calls.\nContext Switch Interface\nThe architecture crates (in the /arch folder) are responsible for implementing\nthe UserspaceKernelBoundary trait which defines the functions needed to allow the\nkernel to correctly switch to userspace. These functions handle the\narchitecture-specific details of how the context switch occurs, such as which\nregisters are saved on the stack, where the stack pointer is stored, and how\ndata is passed for the Tock syscall interface.\nCortex-M Architecture Details\nStarting in the kernel before any application has been run but after the\nprocess has been created, the kernel calls switch_to_user. This code sets up\nregisters for the application, including the PIC base register and the process\nstack pointer, then triggers a service call interrupt with a call to svc.\nThe svc handler code automatically determines if the system desired a switch\nto application or to kernel and sets the processor mode. Finally, the svc\nhandler returns, directing the PC to the entry point of the app.\nThe application runs in unprivileged mode while executing. When it needs to use\na kernel resource it issues a syscall by running svc instruction. The\nsvc_handler determines that it should switch to the kernel from an app, sets\nthe processor mode to privileged, and returns. Since the stack has changed to\nthe kernel's stack pointer (rather than the process stack pointer), execution\nreturns to switch_to_user immediately after the svc that led to the\napplication starting. switch_to_user saves registers and returns to the kernel\nso the system call can be processed.\nOn the next switch_to_user call, the application will resume execution based\non the process stack pointer, which points to the instruction after the system\ncall that switched execution to the kernel.\nSyscalls may clobber userspace memory, as the kernel may write to buffers\npreviously given to it using Allow. The kernel will not clobber any userspace\nregisters except for the return value register (r0). However, Yield must be\ntreated as clobbering more registers, as it can call a callback in userspace\nbefore returning. This callback can clobber r0-r3, r12, and lr. See this\ncomment\nin the libtock-c syscall code for more information about Yield.\nRISC-V Architecture Details\nTock assumes that a RISC-V platform that supports context switching has two\nprivilege modes: machine mode and user mode.\nThe RISC-V architecture provides very lean support for context switching,\nproviding significant flexibility in software on how to support context\nswitches. The hardware guarantees the following will happen during a context\nswitch: when switching from kernel mode to user mode by calling the mret\ninstruction, the PC is set to the value in the mepc CSR, and the privilege\nmode is set to the value in the MPP bits of the mstatus CSR. When switching\nfrom user mode to kernel mode using the ecall instruction, the PC of the\necall instruction is saved to the mepc CSR, the correct bits are set in the\nmcause CSR, and the privilege mode is restored to machine mode. The kernel can\nstore 32 bits of state in the mscratch CSR.\nTock handles context switching using the following process. When switching to\nuserland, all register contents are saved to the kernel's stack. Additionally, a\npointer to a per-process struct of stored process state and the PC of where in\nthe kernel to resume executing after the app switches back to kernel mode are\nstored to the kernel's stack. Then, the PC of the app to start executing is put\ninto the mepc CSR, the kernel stack pointer is saved in mscratch, and the\nprevious contents of the app's registers from the per-process stored state\nstruct are copied back into the registers. Then mret is called to switch to\nuser mode and begin executing the app.\nWhen the app calls a syscall, it uses the ecall instruction. This causes the\ntrap handler to execute. The trap handler checks mscratch, and if the value is\nnonzero then it contains the stack pointer of the kernel and this trap must have\nhappened while the system was executing an application. Then, the kernel stack\npointer from mscratch is used to find the pointer to the stored state struct,\nand all app registers are saved. The trap handler also saves the app PC from the\nmepc CSR and the mcause CSR. It then loads the kernel address of where to\nresume the context switching code to mepc and calls mret to exit the trap\nhandler. Back in the context switching code, the kernel restores its registers\nfrom its stack. Then, using the contents of mcause the kernel decides why the\napplication stopped executing, and if it was a syscall which syscall the app\ncalled. Returning the context switch reason ends the context switching process.\nAll values for the syscall functions are passed in registers a0-a4. No values\nare stored to the application stack. The return value for syscalls is set in a0.\nIn most syscalls the kernel will not clobber any userspace registers except for\nthis return value register (a0). However, the yield() syscall results in a\ncallback getting run in the app. This can clobber all caller saved registers, as\nwell as the return address (ra) register.\nHow System Calls Connect to Drivers\nAfter a system call is made, the call is handled and routed by the Tock kernel\nin sched.rs through a series of steps.\n\nThe kernel calls a platform-provided syscall filter function to determine if\nit should process the syscall or not. This does not apply to yield. The\nfilter function takes the syscall and which process issued the syscall to\nreturn a Result((), ReturnCode) to signal if the syscall should be handled\nor if an error should be returned to the process.\nIf the filter function disallows the syscall it returns Err(ReturnCode) and\nthe ReturnCode is provided to the app as the return code for the syscall.\nOtherwise, the syscall proceeds.\nThe filter interface is currently considered unstable and subject to change.\n\nThe number of the syscall is matched against the valid syscall types. yield\nand memop have special functionality that is handled by the kernel.\ncommand, subscribe, and allow are routed to drivers for handling.\n\nTo route the command, subscribe, and allow syscalls, each board creates\na struct that implements the Platform trait. Implementing that trait only\nrequires implementing a with_driver() function that takes one argument, the\ndriver number, and returns a reference to the correct driver if it is\nsupported or None otherwise. The kernel then calls the appropriate syscall\nfunction on that driver with the remaining syscall arguments.\nAn example board that implements the Platform trait looks something like\nthis:\nstruct TestBoard {\n    console: &'static Console,\n}\n\nimpl Platform for TestBoard {\n    fn with_driver(&self, driver_num: usize, f: F) -> R\n        where F: FnOnce(Option) -> R\n    {\n\n        match driver_num {\n            0 => f(Some(self.console)), // use capsules::console::DRIVER_NUM rather than 0 in real code\n            _ => f(None),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nTestBoard then supports one driver, the UART console, and maps it to driver\nnumber 0. Any command, subscribe, and allow sycalls to driver number 0\nwill get routed to the console, and all other driver numbers will return\nReturnCode::ENODEVICE.\n\n\nAllocated Driver Numbers\nAll documented drivers are in the doc/syscalls folder.\nThe with_driver() function takes an argument driver_num to identify the\ndriver. driver_num whose highest bit is set is private and can be used by\nout-of-tree drivers.\n"},"Userland.html":{"url":"Userland.html","title":"Userland","keywords":"","body":"Userland\nThis document explains how application code works in Tock. This is not a guide\nto creating your own applications, but rather documentation of the design\nthoughts behind how applications function.\n\n\n\nOverview of Applications in Tock\nSystem Calls\nCallbacks\nInter-Process Communication\nServices\nClients\n\n\nApplication Entry Point\nStack and Heap\nDebugging\nApplications\n\n\nOverview of Applications in Tock\nApplications in Tock are the user-level code meant to accomplish some type of\ntask for the end user. Applications are distinguished from kernel code which\nhandles device drivers, chip-specific details, and general operating system\ntasks. Unlike many existing embedded operating systems, in Tock applications\nare not compiled with the kernel. Instead they are entirely separate code\nthat interact with the kernel and each other through system\ncalls.\nSince applications are not a part of the kernel, they may be written in any\nlanguage that can be compiled into code capable of running on a microcontroller.\nTock supports running multiple applications concurrently. Co-operatively\nmultiprogramming is the default, but applications may also be time sliced.\nApplications may talk to each other via Inter-Process Communication (IPC)\nthrough system calls.\nApplications do not have compile-time knowledge of the address at which they\nwill be installed and loaded. In the current design of Tock, applications must\nbe compiled as position independent\ncode (PIC). This\nallows them to be run from any address they happen to be loaded into. The use\nof PIC for Tock apps is not a fundamental choice, future versions of the system\nmay support run-time relocatable code.\nApplications are unprivileged code. They may not access all portions of memory\nand will fault if they attempt to access memory outside of their boundaries\n(similarly to segmentation faults in Linux code). To interact with hardware,\napplications must make calls to the kernel.\nSystem Calls\nSystem calls (aka syscalls) are used to send commands to the kernel. These\ncould include commands to drivers, subscriptions to callbacks, granting of\nmemory to the kernel so it can store data related to the application,\ncommunication with other application code, and many others. In practice,\nsystem calls are made through library code and the application need not\ndeal with them directly.\nFor example, consider the following system call that sets a GPIO pin high:\nint gpio_set(GPIO_Pin_t pin) {\n  return command(GPIO_DRIVER_NUM, 2, pin);\n}\n\nThe command system call itself is implemented as the ARM assembly instruction\nsvc (service call):\nint __attribute__((naked))\ncommand(uint32_t driver, uint32_t command, int data) {\n  asm volatile(\"svc 2\\nbx lr\" ::: \"memory\", \"r0\");\n}\n\nA more in-depth discussion can be found in the system call\ndocumentation.\nCallbacks\nTock is designed to support embedded applications, which often handle\nasynchronous events through the use of callback\nfunctions). For\nexample, in order to receive timer callbacks, you first call timer_subscribe\nwith a function pointer to your own function that you want called when the\ntimer fires. Specific state that you want the callback to act upon can be\npassed as the pointer userdata. After the application has started the timer,\ncalls yield, and the timer fires, the callback function will be called.\nIt is important to note that yield must be called for events to be serviced in\nthe current implementation of Tock. Callbacks to the application will be queued\nwhen they occur but the application will not receive them until it yields. This\nis not fundamental to Tock, and future version may service callbacks on any\nsystem call or when performing application time slicing. After receiving and\nrunning the callback, application code will continue after the yield.\nApplications which are \"finished\" (i.e. have returned from main()) should call\nyield in a loop to avoid being scheduled by the kernel.\nInter-Process Communication\nIPC allows for multiple applications to communicate directly through shared\nbuffers. IPC in Tock is implemented with a service-client model. Each app can\nsupport one service and the service is identified by its package name which is\nincluded in the Tock Binary Format Header for the app. An app can communicate\nwith multiple services and will get a unique handle for each discovered service.\nClients and services communicate through shared buffers. Each client can share\nsome of its own application memory with the service and then notify the service\nto instruct it to parse the shared buffer.\nServices\nServices are named by the package name included in the app's TBF header.\nTo register a service, an app can call ipc_register_svc() to setup a callback.\nThis callback will be called whenever a client calls notify on that service.\nClients\nClients must first discover services they wish to use with the function\nipc_discover(). They can then share a buffer with the service by calling\nipc_share(). To instruct the service to do something with the buffer, the\nclient can call ipc_notify_svc(). If the app wants to get notifications from\nthe service, it must call ipc_register_client_cb() to receive events from when\nthe service when the service calls ipc_notify_client().\nSee ipc.h in libtock-c for more information on these functions.\nApplication Entry Point\nAn application specifies the first function the kernel should call by setting\nthe variable init_fn_offset in its TBF header. This function should have the\nfollowing signature:\nvoid _start(void* text_start, void* mem_start, void* memory_len, void* app_heap_break);\n\nThe Tock kernel tries to impart no restrictions on the stack and heap layout of\napplication processes. As such, a process starts in a very minimal environment,\nwith an initial stack sufficient to support a syscall, but not much more.\nApplication startup routines should first\nmove their program break to accomodate\ntheir desired layout, and then setup local stack and heap tracking in accordance\nwith their runtime.\nStack and Heap\nApplications can specify memory requirements by setting the minimum_ram_size variable\nin their TBF headers. Note that the Tock kernel treats this as a minimum,\ndepending on the underlying platform, the amount of memory may be larger than\nrequested, but will never be smaller.\nIf there is insufficient memory to load your application, the kernel will fail\nduring loading and print a message.\nIf an application exceeds its alloted memory during runtime, the application\nwill crash (see the Debugging section for an example).\nDebugging\nIf an application crashes, Tock can provide a lot of useful information.\nBy default, when an application crashes Tock prints a crash dump over the\nplatform's default console interface.\nNote that because an application is relocated when it is loaded, the binaries\nand debugging .lst files generated when the app was originally compiled will not\nmatch the actual executing application on the board. To generate matching files\n(and in particular a matching .lst file), you can use the make debug target\napp directory to create an appropriate .lst file that matches how the\napplication was actually executed. See the end of the debug print out for an\nexample command invocation.\n---| Fault Status |---\nData Access Violation:              true\nForced Hard Fault:                  true\nFaulting Memory Address:            0x00000000\nFault Status Register (CFSR):       0x00000082\nHard Fault Status Register (HFSR):  0x40000000\n\n---| App Status |---\nApp: crash_dummy   -   [Fault]\n Events Queued: 0   Syscall Count: 0   Dropped Callback Count: 0\n Restart Count: 0\n Last Syscall: None\n\n ╔═══════════╤══════════════════════════════════════════╗\n ║  Address  │ Region Name    Used | Allocated (bytes)  ║\n ╚0x20006000═╪══════════════════════════════════════════╝\n             │ ▼ Grant         948 |    948\n  0x20005C4C ┼───────────────────────────────────────────\n             │ Unused\n  0x200049F0 ┼───────────────────────────────────────────\n             │ ▲ Heap            0 |   4700               S\n  0x200049F0 ┼─────────────────────────────────────────── R\n             │ Data            496 |    496               A\n  0x20004800 ┼─────────────────────────────────────────── M\n             │ ▼ Stack          72 |   2048\n  0x200047B8 ┼───────────────────────────────────────────\n             │ Unused\n  0x20004000 ┴───────────────────────────────────────────\n             .....\n  0x00030400 ┬─────────────────────────────────────────── F\n             │ App Flash       976                        L\n  0x00030030 ┼─────────────────────────────────────────── A\n             │ Protected        48                        S\n  0x00030000 ┴─────────────────────────────────────────── H\n\n  R0 : 0x00000000    R6 : 0x20004894\n  R1 : 0x00000001    R7 : 0x20004000\n  R2 : 0x00000000    R8 : 0x00000000\n  R3 : 0x00000000    R10: 0x00000000\n  R4 : 0x00000000    R11: 0x00000000\n  R5 : 0x20004800    R12: 0x12E36C82\n  R9 : 0x20004800 (Static Base Register)\n  SP : 0x200047B8 (Process Stack Pointer)\n  LR : 0x000301B7\n  PC : 0x000300AA\n YPC : 0x000301B6\n\n APSR: N 0 Z 1 C 1 V 0 Q 0\n       GE 0 0 0 0\n EPSR: ICI.IT 0x00\n       ThumbBit true\n\n Cortex-M MPU\n  Region 0: base: 0x20004000, length: 8192 bytes; ReadWrite (0x3)\n  Region 1: base:    0x30000, length: 1024 bytes; ReadOnly (0x6)\n  Region 2: Unused\n  Region 3: Unused\n  Region 4: Unused\n  Region 5: Unused\n  Region 6: Unused\n  Region 7: Unused\n\nTo debug, run `make debug RAM_START=0x20004000 FLASH_INIT=0x30059`\nin the app's folder and open the .lst file.\nApplications\nFor example applications, see the language specific userland repos:\n\nlibtock-c: C and C++ apps.\nlibtock-rs: Rust apps.\n\n"},"Networking_Stack.html":{"url":"Networking_Stack.html","title":"Networking Stack","keywords":"","body":"Tock Networking Stack Design Document\nNOTE: This document is a work in progress.\nThis document describes the design of the Networking stack on Tock.\nThe design described in this document is based off of ideas contributed by\nPhil Levis, Amit Levy, Paul Crews, Hubert Teo, Mateo Garcia, Daniel Giffin, and\nHudson Ayers.\nTable of Contents\nThis document is split into several sections. These are as follows:\n\nPrinciples - Describes the main principles which the design of\nthis stack intended to meet,\nalong with some justification of why these principles matter. Ultimately,\nthe design should follow from these principles.\n\nStack Diagram - Graphically depicts the layout of the stack\n\nExplanation of queuing - Describes where packets are queued prior to\ntransmission.\n\nList of Traits - Describes the traits which will exist at each layer of the\nstack. For traits that may seem surprisingly complex, provide examples of\nspecific messages that require this more complex trait as opposed to the\nmore obvious, simpler trait that might be expected.\n\nExplanation of Queuing - Describe queueing principles for this stack\n\nDescription of rx path\n\nDescription of the userland interface to the networking stack\n\nImplementation Details - Describes how certain implementations of these\ntraits will work, providing some examples with pseudocode or commented\nexplanations of functionality\n\nExample Message Traversals - Shows how different example messages (Thread or\notherwise) will traverse the stack\n\n\nPrinciples\n\nKeep the simple case simple\n\nSending an IP packet via an established network should not\nrequire a more complicated interface than send(destination, packet)\nIf functionality were added to allow for the transmission of IP packets over\nthe BLE interface, this IP send function should not have to deal with any\noptions or MessageInfo structs that include 802.15.4 layer information.\nThis principle reflects a desire to limit the complexity of Thread/the\ntock networking stack to the capsules that implement the stack. This\nprevents the burden of this complexity from being passed up to whatever\napplications use Thread\n\n\nLayering is separate from encapsulation\n\nLibraries that handle encapsulation should not be contained within any\nspecific layering construct. For example, If the Thread control unit wants\nto encapsulate a UDP payload inside of a UDP packet inside of an IP packet,\nit should be able to do so using encapsulation libraries and get the\nresulting IP packet without having to pass through all of the protocol layers\nAccordingly, implementations of layers can take advantage of these\nencapsulation libraries, but are not required to.\n\n\nDataplane traits are Thread-independent\n\nFor example, the IP trait should not make any assumption that send()\nwill be called for a message that will be passed down to the 15.4 layer, in\ncase this IP trait is used on top of an implementation that passes IP\npackets down to be sent over a BLE link layer. Accordingly the IP trait\ncan not expose any arguments regarding 802.15.4 security parameters.\nEven for instances where the only implementation of a trait in the near\nfuture will be a Thread-based implementation, the traits should not\nrequire anything that limit such a trait to Thread-based implementations\n\n\nTransmission and reception APIs are decoupled\n\nThis allows for instances where receive and send_done callbacks should\nbe delivered to different clients (ex: Server listening on all addresses\nbut also sending messages from specific addresses)\nPrevents send path from having to navigate the added complexity required\nfor Thread to determine whether to forward received messages up the stack\n\n\n\nStack Diagram\nIPv6 over ethernet:      Non-Thread 15.4:   Thread Stack:                                       Encapsulation Libraries\n+-------------------+-------------------+----------------------------+\n|                         Application                                |-------------------\\\n----------------------------------------+-------------+---+----------+                    \\\n|TCP Send| UDP Send |TCP Send| UDP Send |  | TCP Send |   | UDP Send |--\\                  v\n+--------+----------+--------+----------+  +----------+   +----------+   \\               +------------+  +------------+\n|     IP Send       |     IP Send       |  |         IP Send         |    \\      ----->  | UDP Packet |  | TCP Packet |\n|                   |                   |  +-------------------------+     \\    /        +------------+  +------------+\n|                   |                   |                            |      \\  /         +-----------+\n|                   |                   |                            |       -+------->  | IP Packet |\n|                   |                   |       THREAD               |       /           +-----------+\n| IP Send calls eth | IP Send calls 15.4|                               +-------------------------+\n| 6lowpan libs with | 6lowpan libs with |                            |       \\ ------->  | 6lowpan compress_Packet |\n| default values    | default values    |                            |        \\          +-------------------------+\n|                   |                   |                            |         \\         +-------------------------+\n|                   |                   +                +-----------|          ------>  | 6lowpan fragment_Packet |\n|                   |                   |                | 15.4 Send |                   +-------------------------+\n|-------------------|-------------------+----------------------------+\n|     ethernet      |          IEEE 802.15.4 Link Layer              |\n+-------------------+------------------------------------------------+\nNotes on the stack:\n\nIP messages sent via Thread networks are sent through Thread using an IP Send\nmethod that exposes only the parameters specified in the IP_Send trait.\nOther parameters of the message (6lowpan decisions, link layer parameters,\nmany IP header options) are decided by Thread.\nThe stack provides an interface for the application layer to send\nraw IPv6 packets over Thread.\nWhen the Thread control plane generates messages (MLE messages etc.), they are\nformatted using calls to the encapsulation libraries and then delivered to the\n802.15.4 layer using the 15.4 send function\nThis stack design allows Thread to control header elements from transport down\nto link layer, and to set link layer security parameters and more as required\nfor certain packers\nThe application can either directly send IP messages using the IP Send\nimplementation exposed by the Thread stack or it can use the UDP Send\nand TCP send implementation exposed by the Thread stack. If the application\nuses the TCP or UDP send implementations it must use the transport packet library\nto insert its payload inside a packet and set certain header fields.\nThe transport send method uses the IP Packet library to set certain\nIP fields before handing the packet off to Thread. Thread then sets other\nparameters at other layers as needed before sending the packet off via the\n15.4 send function implemented for Thread.\nNote that currently this design leaves it up to the application layer to\ndecide what interface any given packet will be transmitted from. This is\nbecause currently we are working towards a minimum functional stack.\nHowever, once this is working we intend to add a layer below the application\nlayer that would handle interface multiplexing by destination address via a\nforwarding table. This should be straightforward to add in to our current\ndesign.\nThis stack does not demonstrate a full set of functionality we are planning to\nimplement now. Rather it demonstrates how this setup allows for multiple\nimplementations of each layer based off of traits and libraries such that a\nflexible network stack can be configured, rather than creating a network\nstack designed such that applications can only use Thread.\n\nExplanation of Queuing\nQueuing happens at the application layer in this stack.\nThe userland interface to the\nnetworking stack (described in greater detail in Networking_Userland.md)\nalready handles queueing multiple packets sent from userland apps.\nIn the kernel, any application which wishes to send multiple UDP packets must\nhandle queueing itself, waiting for a send_done to return from the radio\nbefore calling send on the next packet in a series of packets.\nList of Traits\nThis section describes a number of traits which must be implemented by any\nnetwork stack. It is expected that multiple implementations of some of these\ntraits may exist to allow for Tock to support more than just Thread networking.\nBefore discussing these traits - a note on buffers:\n\n   Prior implementations of the tock networking stack passed around references\n   to 'static mut [u8] to pass packets along the stack. This is not ideal from a\n   standpoint of wanting\n   to be able to prevent as many errors as possible at compile time. The next iteration\n   of code will pass 'typed' buffers up and down the stack. There are a number\n   of packet library traits defined below (e.g. IPPacket, UDPPacket, etc.).\n   Transport Layer traits will be implemented by a struct that will contain at least one field -\n   a [u8] buffer with lifetime 'a. Lower level traits will simply contain\n   payload fields that are Transport Level packet traits (thanks to a\n   TransportPacket enum). This design allows for all buffers passed to\n   be passed as type 'UDPPacket', 'IPPacket', etc. An added advantage of this\n   design is that each buffer can easily be operated on using the library\n   functions associated with this buffer type.\n\nThe traits below are organized by the network layer they would typically be\nassociated with.\nTransport Layer\nThus far, the only transport layer protocol implemented in Tock is UDP.\nDocumentation describing the structs and traits that define the UDP layer can\nbe found in capsules/src/net/udp/(udp.rs, udp_send.rs, udp_recv.rs)\nAdditionally, a driver exists that provides a userland interface via which\nudp packets can be sent and received. This is described in greater detail in\nNetworking_Userland.md\nNetwork Stack Receive Path\n\nThe radio in the kernel has a single RxClient, which is set as the mac layer (awake_mac, typically)\nThe mac layer (i.e. AwakeMac) has a single RxClient, which is the mac_device(ieee802154::Framer::framer)\nThe Mac device has a single receive client - MuxMac (virtual MAC device).\nThe MuxMac can have multiple \"users\" which are of type MacUser\nAny received packet is passed to ALL MacUsers, which are expected to filter packets themselves accordingly.\nRight now, we initialize two MacUsers in the kernel (in main.rs/components). These are the 'radio_mac', which is the MacUser for the RadioDriver that enables the userland interface to directly send 802154 frames, and udp_mac, the mac layer that is ultimately associated with the udp userland interface.\nThe udp_mac MacUser has a single receive client, which is the sixlowpan_state struct\nsixlowpan_state has a single rx_client, which in our case is a single struct that implements the ip_receive trait.\nthe ip_receive implementing struct (IP6RecvStruct) has a single client, which is udp_recv, a UDPReceive struct.\nThe UDPReceive struct is a field of the UDPDriver, which ultimately passes the packets up to userland.\n\nSo what are the implications of all this?\n1) Currently, any userland app could receive udp packets intended for\nanyone else if the app implmenets 6lowpan itself on the received raw frames.\n2) Currently, packets are only muxed at the Mac layer.\n3) Right now the IPReceive struct receives all IP packets sent to the MAC address of this device, and soon will drop all packets sent to non-local addresses. Right now, the device effectively only has one address anyway, as we only support 6lowpan over 15.4, and as we haven't implemented a loopback interface on the IP_send path. If, in the future, we implement IP forwarding on Tock, we will need to add an IPSend object to the IPReceiver which would then retransmit any packets received that were not destined for local addresses.\nExplanation of Configuration\nThis section describes how the IP stack can be configured, including setting\naddresses and other parameters of the MAC layer.\n\nSource IP address: An array of local interfaces on the device is contained in main.rs.\nCurrently, this array contains two hardcoded addresses, and one address generated from the\nunique serial number on the sam4l.\n\nDestination IP address: The destination IP address is configured by passing the address\nto the send_to() call when sending IPv6 packets.\n\nsrc MAC address: This address is configured in main.rs. Currently, the src mac address\nfor each device is configured by default to be a 16-bit short address representing the last 16 bits\nof the unique 120 bit serial number on the sam4l. However, userland apps can change the src address\nby calling ieee802154_set_address()\n\ndst MAC address: This is currently a constant set in main.rs. (DST_MAC_ADDR). In the future\nthis will change, once Tock implements IPv6 Neighbor Discovery.\n\nsrc pan: This is set via a constant configured in main.rs (PAN_ID). The same constant is used\nfor the dst pan.\n\ndst pan: Same as src_pan. If we need to support use of the broadcast PAN as a dst_pan, this\nmay change.\n\nradio channel: Configured as a constant in main.rs (RADIO_CHANNEL).\n\n\nTock Userland Networking Design\nThis section describes the current userland interface for the networking stack\non Tock. This section should serve as a description of the abstraction\nprovided by libTock - what the exact system call interface looks like or how\nlibTock or the kernel implements this functionality is out-of-scope of this\ndocument.\nOverview\nThe Tock networking stack and libTock should attempt to expose a networking\ninterface that is similar to the POSIX networking interface. The primary\nmotivation for this design choice is that application programmers are used\nto the POSIX networking interface design, and significant amounts of code\nhave already been written for POSIX-style network interfaces. By designing\nthe libTock networking interface to be as similar to POSIX as possible, we\nhope to improve developer experience while enabling the easy transition of\nnetworking code to Tock.\nDesign\nudp.c and udp.h in libtock-c/libtock define the userland interface to the\nTock networking stack. These files interact with capsules/src/net/udp/driver.rs\nin the main tock repository. driver.rs implements an interface for sending\nand receiving UDP messages. It also exposes a list of interace addresses to\nthe application layer. The primary functionality embedded in the UDP driver\nis within the allow(), subscribe(), and command() calls which can be made to\nthe driver.\nDetails of this driver can be found in doc/syscalls folder\nudp.c and udp.h in libtock-c make it easy to interact with this driver interface.\nImportant functions available to userland apps written in c include:\nudp_socket() - sets the port on which the app will receive udp packets,\n                 and sets the src_port of outgoing packets sent via that socket. Once socket\n                 binding is implemented in the kernel, this function will handle reserving ports\n                 to listen on and send from.\nudp_close() - currently just returns success, but once socket binding has been\n                implemented in the kernel, this function will handle freeing bound ports.\nudp_send_to() - Sends a udp packet to a specified addr/port pair, returns the result\n                  of the tranmission once the radio has transmitted it (or once a failure has occured).\nudp_recv_from_sync() - Pass an interface to listen on and an incoming source address\n                         to listen for. Sets up a callback to wait for a received packet, and yeilds until that\n                         callback is triggered. This function never returns if a packet is not received.\nudp_recv_from() - Pass an interface to listen on and an incoming source address to\n                    listen for. However, this takes in a buffer to which the received packet should be placed,\n                    and returns the callback that will be triggered when a packet is received.\nudp_list_ifaces() - Populates the passed pointer of ipv6 addresses with the available\n                      ipv6 addresses of the interfaces on the device. Right now this merely returns a constant\n                      hardcoded into the UDP driver, but should change to return the source IP addresses held\n                      in the network configuration file once that is created. Returns up to len addresses.\nOther design notes:\nThe current design of the driver has a few limitations, these include:\n\nCurrently, any app can listen on any address/port pair\n\nThe current tx implementation allows for starvation, e.g. an app with an earlier app ID can\nstarve a later ID by sending constantly.\n\n\nPOSIX Socket API Functions\nBelow is a fairly comprehensive overview of the POSIX networking socket\ninterface. Note that much of this functionality pertains to TCP or connection-\nbased protocols, which we currently do not handle.\n\nsocket(domain, type, protocol) -> int fd\n\ndomain: AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNIX\ntype: SOCK_STREAM (TCP), SOCK_DGRAM (UDP), SOCK_SEQPACKET (?), SOCK_RAW\nprotocol: IPPROTO_TCP, IPPROTO_SCTP, IPPROTO_UDP, IPPROTO_DCCP\n\n\nbind(socketfd, my_addr, addrlen) -> int success\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor to bind to\nmy_addr: Address to bind on\naddrlen: Length of address\n\n\nlisten(socketfd, backlog) -> int success\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor\nbacklog: Number of pending connections to be queued\nOnly necessary for stream-oriented data modes\n\n\n\nconnect(socketfd, addr, addrlen) -> int success\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor to connect with\naddr: Address to connect to (server protocol address)\naddrlen: Length of address\nWhen used with connectionless protocols, defines the remote address for\nsending and receiving data, allowing the use of functions such as send()\nand recv() and preventing the reception of datagrams from other sources.\n\n\n\naccept(socketfd, cliaddr, addrlen) -> int success\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor of the listening socket that has the\nconnection queued\ncliaddr: A pointer to an address to receive the client's address information\naddrlen: Specifies the size of the client address structure\n\n\nsend(socketfd, buffer, length, flags) -> int success\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor to send on\nbuffer: Buffer to send\nlength: Length of buffer to send\nflags: Various flags for the transmission\nNote that the send() function will only send a message when the socketfd\nis connected (including for connectionless sockets)\n\n\n\nsendto(socketfd, buffer, length, flags, dst_addr, addrlen) -> int success\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor to send on\nbuffer: Buffer to send\nlength: Length of buffer to send\nflags: Various flags for the transmission\ndst_addr: Address to send to (ignored for connection type sockets)\naddrlen: Length of dst_addr\nNote that if the socket is a connection type, dst_addr will be ignored.\n\n\n\nrecv(socketfd, buffer, length, flags)\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor to receive on\nbuffer: Buffer where the message will be stored\nlength: Length of buffer\nflags: Type of message reception\nTypically used with connected sockets as it does not permit the application\nto retrieve the source address of received data.\n\n\n\nrecvfrom(socketfd, buffer, length, flags, address, addrlen)\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor to receive on\nbuffer: Buffer to store the message\nlength: Length of the buffer\nflags: Various flags for reception\naddress: Pointer to a structure to store the sending address\naddrlen: Length of address structure\nNormally used with connectionless sockets as it permits the application to\nretrieve the source address of received data\n\n\n\nclose(socketfd)\n\nsocketfd: Socket file descriptor to delete\n\n\ngethostbyname()/gethostbyaddr()\n  Legacy interfaces for resolving host names and addresses\n\nselect(nfds, readfds, writefds, errorfds, timeout)\n\nnfds: The range of file descriptors to be tested (0..nfds)\nreadfds: On input, specifies file descriptors to be checked to see if they\nare ready to be read. On output, indicates which file descriptors are ready\nto be read\nwritefds: Same as readfds, but for writing\nerrorfds: Same as readfds, writefds, but for errors\ntimeout: A structure that indicates the max amount of time to block if\nno file descriptors are ready. If None, blocks indefinitely\n\n\npoll(fds, nfds, timeout)\n\nfds: Array of structures for file descriptors to be checked. The array\nmembers are structures which contain the file descriptor, and events\nto check for plus areas to write which events occurred\nnfds: Number of elements in the fds array\ntimeout: If 0 return immediately, or if -1 block indefinitely. Otherwise,\nwait at least timeout milliseconds for an event to occur\n\n\ngetsockopt()/setsockopt()\n\n\nTock Userland API\nBelow is a list of desired functionality for the libTock userland API.\n\nstruct sock_addr_t\n  ipv6_addr_t: IPv6 address (single or ANY)\n  port_t: Transport level port (single or ANY)\n\nstruct sock_handle_t\n  Opaque to the user; allocated in userland by malloc (or on the stack)\n\nlist_ifaces() -> iface[]\n  ifaces: A list of ipv6_addr_t, name pairs corresponding to all\n  interfaces available\n\nudp_socket(sock_handle_t, sock_addr_t) -> int socketfd\n  socketfd: Socket object to be initialized as a UDP socket with the given\n  address information\n  sock_addr_t: Contains an IPv6 address and a port\n\nudp_close(sock_handle_t)\n  sock_handle_t: Socket to close\n\nsend_to(sock_handle_t, buffer, length, sock_addr_t)\n\nsock_handle_t: Socket to send using\nbuffer: Buffer to send\nlength: Length of buffer to send\nsock_addr_t: Address struct (IPv6 address, port) to send the packet from\n\n\nrecv_from(sock_handle_t, buffer, length, sock_addr_t)\n\nsock_handle_t: Receiving socket\nbuffer: Buffer to receive into\nlength: Length of buffer\nsock_addr_t: Struct where the kernel writes the received packet's sender\ninformation\n\n\n\nDifferences Between the APIs\nThere are two major differences between the proposed Tock APIs and the standard\nPOSIX APIs. First, the POSIX APIs must support connection-based protocols such\nas TCP, whereas the Tock API is only concerned with connectionless, datagram\nbased protocols. Second, the POSIX interface has a concept of the sock_addr_t\nstructure, which is used to encapsulate information such as port numbers to\nbind on and interface addresses. This makes bind_to_port redundant in POSIX,\nas we can simply set the port number in the sock_addr_t struct when binding.\nI think one of the major questions is whether to adopt this convention, or to\nuse the above definitions for at least the first iteration.\nExample: ip_sense\nAn example use of the userland networking stack can be found in libtock-c/examples/ip_sense\nImplementation Details for potential future Thread implementation\nThis section was written when the networking stack was incomplete, and aspects\nmay be outdated. This goes for all sections following this point in the document.\nThe Thread specification determines an entire control plane that spans many\ndifferent layers in the OSI networking model. To adequately understand the\ninteractions and dependencies between these layers' behaviors, it might help to\ntrace several types of messages and see how each layer processes the different\ntypes of messages. Let's trace carefully the way OpenThread handles messages.\nWe begin with the most fundamental message: a data-plane message that does not\ninteract with the Thread control plane save for passing through a\nThread-defined network interface. Note that some of the procedures in the below\ntraces will not make sense when taken independently: the responsibility-passing\nwill only make sense when all the message types are taken as a whole.\nAdditionally, no claim is made as to whether or not this sequence of callbacks\nis the optimal way to express these interactions: it is just OpenThread's way\nof doing it.\nData plane: IPv6 datagram\n\nUpper layer (application) wants to send a payload\nProvides payload\nSpecifies the IP6 interface to send it on (via some identifier)\nSpecifies protocol (IP6 next header field)\nSpecifies destination IP6 address\nPossibly doesn't specify source IP6 address\n\n\nIP6 interface dispatcher (with knowledge of all the interfaces) fills in the\nIP6 header and produces an IP6 message\nPayload, protocol, and destination address used directly from the upper layer\nSource address is more complicated\nIf the address is specified and is not multicast, it is used directly\nIf the address is unspecified or multicast, source address is determined\nfrom the specific IP6 selected AND the destination address via a matching scheme on\nthe addresses associated with the interface.\n\n\nNow that the addresses are determined, the IP6 layer computes the pseudoheader\nchecksum.\nIf the application layer's payload has a checksum that includes the pseudoheader\n(UDP, ICMP6), this partial checksum is now used to update the checksum field in the payload.\n\n\n\n\nThe actual IP6 interface (Thread-controlled) tries to send that message\nFirst step is to determine whether the message can be sent immediately or not (sleepy child or not).\n  This passes the message to the scheduler. This is important for sleepy children where there is a\n  control scheme that determines when messages are sent.\nNext, determine the MAC src/dest addresses.\nIf this is a direct transmission, there is a source matching scheme to determine if the destination address\nused should be short or long. The same length is used for the source MAC address, obtained from the MAC interface.\n\n\nNotify the MAC layer to notify you that your message can be sent.\n\n\nThe MAC layer schedules its transmissions and determines that it can send the above message\nMAC sets the transmission power\nMAC sets the channel differently depending on the message type\n\n\nThe IP6 interface fills up the frame. This is the chance for the IP6 interface to do things like\nfragmentation, retransmission, and so on. The MAC layer just wants a frame.\nXXX: The IP6 interface fills up the MAC header. This should really be the responsibility of the MAC layer.\nAnyway, here is what is done:\nChannel, source PAN ID, destination PAN ID, and security modes are determined by message type.\nNote that the channel set by the MAC layer is sometimes overwritten.\nA mesh extension header is added for some messages. (eg. indirect transmissions)\n\n\nThe IP6 message is then 6LoWPAN-compressed/fragmented into the payload section of the frame.\n\n\nThe MAC layer receives the raw frame and tries to send it\nMAC sets the sequence number of the frame (from the previous sequence number for the correct link neighbor),\nif it is not a retransmission\nThe frame is secured if needed. This is another can of worms:\nFrame counter is dependent on the link neighbor and whether or not the frame is a retransmission\nKey is dependent on which key id mode is selected, and also the link neighbor's key sequence\nKey sequence != frame counter\nOne particular mode requires using a key, source and frame counter that is a Thread-defined constant.\n\n\nThe frame is transmitted, an ACK is waited for, and the process completes.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the data dependencies are nowhere as clean as the OSI model\ndictates. The complexity mostly arises because\n\nLayer 4 checksum can include IPv6 pseudoheader\nIP6 source address (mesh local? link local? multicast?) is determined by\ninterface and destination address\nMAC src/dest addresses are dependent on the next device on the route to the\nIP6 destination address\nChannel, src/dest PAN ID, security is dependent on message type\nMesh extension header presence is dependent on message type\nSequence number is dependent on message type and destination\n\nNote that all of the MAC layer dependencies in step 5 can be pre-decided so\nthat the MAC layer is the only one responsible for writing the MAC header.\nThis gives a pretty good overview of what minimally needs to be done to even be\nable to send normal IPv6 datagrams, but does not cover all of Thread's\ncomplexities. Next, we look at some control-plane messages.\nControl plane: MLE messages\n\nThe MLE layer encapsulates its messages in UDP on a constant port\nSecurity is determined by MLE message type. If MLE-layer security is\nrequired, the frame is secured using the same CCM* encryption scheme used\nin the MAC layer, but with a different key discipline.\nMLE key sequence is global across a single Thread device\nMLE sets IP6 source address to the interface's link local address\n\n\nThis UDP-encapsulated MLE message is sent to the IP6 dispatch again\nThe actual IP6 interface (Thread-controlled) tries to send that message\nThe MAC layer schedules the transmission\nThe IP6 interface fills up the frame.\nMLE messages disable link-layer security when MLE-layer security is\npresent. However, if link-layer security is disabled and the MLE message\ndoesn't fit in a single frame, link-layer security is enabled so that\nfragmentation can proceed.\n\n\nThe MAC layer receives the raw frame and tries to send it\n\nThe only cross-layer dependency introduced by the MLE layer is the dependency\nbetween MLE-layer security and link-layer security. Whether or not the MLE\nlayer sits atop an actual UDP socket is an implementation detail.\nControl plane: Mesh forwarding\nIf Thread REED devices are to be eventually supported in Tock, then we must\nalso consider this case. If a frame is sent to a router which is not its final\ndestination, then the router must forward that message to the next hop.\n\nThe MAC layer receives a frame, decrypts it and passes it to the IP6 interface\nThe IP6 reception reads the frame and realizes that it is an indirect\ntransmission that has to be forwarded again\nThe frame must contain a mesh header, and the HopsLeft field in it should\nbe decremented\nThe rest of the payload remains the same\nHence, the IP6 interface needs to send a raw 6LoWPAN-compressed frame\n\n\nThe IP6 transmission interface receives a raw 6LoWPAN-compressed frame to be\ntransmitted again\nThis frame must still be scheduled: it might be destined for a sleepy\ndevice that is not yet awake\n\n\nThe MAC layer schedules the transmission\nThe IP6 transmission interface copies the frame to be retransmitted\nverbatim, but with the modified mesh header and a new MAC header\nThe MAC layer receives the raw frame and tries to send it\n\nThis example shows that the IP6 transmission interface may need to handle more\nmessage types than just IP6 datagrams: there is a case where it is convenient\nto be able to handle a datagram that is already 6LoWPAN compressed.\nControl plane: MAC data polling\nFrom time to time, a sleepy edge device will wake up and begin polling its\nparent to check if any frames are available for it. This is done via a MAC\ncommand frame, which must still be sent through the transmission pipeline with\nlink security enabled (Key ID mode 1).  OpenThread does this by routing it\nthrough the IP6 transmission interface, which arguably isn't the right choice.\n\nData poll manager send a data poll message directly to the IP6 transmission\ninterface, skipping the IP6 dispatch\nThe IP6 transmission interface notices the different type of message, which\nalways warrants a direct transmission.\nThe MAC layer schedules the transmission\nThe IP6 transmission interface fills in the frame\nThe MAC dest is set to the parent of this node and the MAC src is set to be\nthe same length as the address of the parent\nThe payload is filled up to contain the Data Request MAC command\nThe MAC security level and key ID mode is also fixed for MAC commands under\nthe Thread specification\n\n\nThe MAC layer secures the frame and sends it out\n\nWe could imagine giving the data poll manager direct access as a client of the\nMAC layer to avoid having to shuffle data through the IP6 transmission\ninterface. This is only justified because MAC command frames are never\n6LoWPAN-compressed or fragmented, nor do they depend on the IP6 interface in\nany way.\nControl plane: Child supervision\nThis type of message behaves similarly to the MAC data polls. The message is\nessentially and empty MAC frame, but OpenThread chooses to also route it\nthrough the IP6 transmission interface. It would be far better to allow a child\nsupervision implementation to be a direct client of the MAC interface.\nControl plane: Joiner entrust and MLE announce\nThese two message types are also explicitly marked, because they require a\nspecific Key ID Mode to be selected when producing the frame for the MAC\ninterface.\nCaveat about MAC layer security\nSo far, it seems like we can expect the MAC layer to have no cross-layer\ndependencies: it receives frames with a completely specified description of how\nthey are to be secured and transmitted, and just does so. However, this is not\nentirely the case.\nWhen the frame is being secured, the key ID mode has been set by the upper\nlayers as described above, and this key ID mode is used to select between a few\ndifferent key disciplines. For example, mode 0 is only used by Joiner entrust\nmessages and uses the Thread KEK sequence. Mode 1 uses the MAC key sequence and\nMode 2 is a constant key used only in MLE announce messages. Hence, this key ID\nmode selection is actually enabling an upper layer to determine the specific\nkey being used in the link layer.\nNote that we cannot just reduce this dependency by allowing the upper layer to\nspecify the key used in MAC encryption. During frame reception, the MAC layer\nitself has to know which key to use in order to decrypt the frames correctly.\n"},"Configuration.html":{"url":"Configuration.html","title":"Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Configuration\nBecause Tock is meant to run on various platforms (spanning multiple\narchitectures and various available peripherals), and with multiple use cases in\nmind (for example, \"production\" vs. debug build with various levels of debugging\ndetail), Tock provides various configuration options so that each build can be\nadapted to each use case.\nIn Tock, configuration follows some principles to avoid pitfalls of \"ifdef\"\nconditional code (which can be tricky to test).

Note that the build system is capable\nof installing some of these tools, but you can also install them yourself.\nRust (nightly)\nWe are using nightly-2020-06-03. We require\ninstalling it with rustup so you can manage multiple\nversions of Rust and continue using stable versions for other Rust code:\n$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n\nThis will install rustup in your home directory, so you will need to\nsource ~/.profile or open a new shell to add the .cargo/bin directory\nto your $PATH.\nThen install the correct nightly version of Rust:\n$ rustup install nightly-2020-06-03\n\nTockloader\ntockloader programs the kernel and applications onto boards, and also has\nfeatures that are generally useful for all Tock boards, such as easy-to-manage\nserial connections, along with the ability to list, add, replace, and remove\napplications over JTAG (or USB if a bootloader is installed).\n\ntockloader (version >= 1.0)\n\nTockloader is a Python application and can be installed with the Python\npackage manager (pip).\n(Linux): pip3 install --upgrade tockloader --user\n(MacOS): pip3 install --upgrade tockloader\n\nCompiling the Kernel\nTock builds a unique kernel for every board it supports. Boards include\ndetails like pulling together the correct chips and pin assignments. To\nbuild a kernel, first choose a board, then navigate to that board directory.\ne.g. cd boards/nordic/nrf52840dk ; make.\nSome boards have special build options that can only be used within the board's\ndirectory.  All boards share a few common targets:\n\nall (default): Compile Tock for this board.\ndebug: Generate build(s) for debugging support, details vary per board.\ndoc: Build documentation for this board.\nclean: Remove built artifacts for this board.\nflash: Load code using JTAG, if available.\nprogram: Load code using a bootloader, if available.\n\nThe board-specific READMEs in each board's\nsubdirectory provide more details for each platform.\nLoading the kernel onto a board\nThe process to load the kernel onto the board depends on the board.\nThere are two main variants: some boards (notably the\nImix and Hail\nboards) have a serial bootloader, most other boards use a programming\nadapter that supports the JTAG or SWD protocol instead.\nTo load a kernel onto a board using a serial bootloader, no other\nsoftware is required and you can just run\n$ make program\nin the board's directory. To load the kernel using a programming\nadapter, you need the appropriate software that supports the adapter\nand can then install the kernel by running\n$ make flash\nDepending on the adapter, you will need either the free openocd or\nSegger's proprietary JLinkExe. Programming adapters are available as\nstandalone devices (for example the JLink EDU JTAG\ndebugger available on\nDigikey),\nbut most development boards come with an onboard programming and\ndebugging adapter. In that case, the board you use determines which\nsoftware you will need and the Makefile in the board directory will\nknow which one to call. Again, the board-specific\nREADMEs provide the required details.\nInstalling JLinkExe\nJLink is available from the Segger\nwebsite. You want to install\nthe \"J-Link Software and Documentation Pack\". There are various\npackages available depending on operating system. We require a version\ngreater than or equal to 5.0.\nInstalling openocd\nOpenocd works with various programming and debugging adapters. For\nmost purposes, available distribution packages are sufficient and it can\nbe installed with:\n(Linux/Debian): sudo apt-get install openocd\n(MacOS): brew install open-ocd\n\nWe require at least version 0.8.0 to support the SAM4L on imix if\nyou choose to flash it using an adapter instead of the bootloader.\nSome boards (at the time of writing the HiFive1 RISC-V board) may\nrequire newer or unreleased versions, in that case you should follow\nthe installation instructions on the openocd\nwebsite.\n(Linux): Adding a udev rule\nDepending on which programming adapter you use, you may want to add a\nudev rule in /etc/udev/rules.d that allows you to interact with\nthe board as a user instead of as root. If you install the deb\npacket of the JLink software it will automatically install a\n/etc/udev/rules.d/99-jlink.rules that allows everyone to access the\nadapter. If you use something else, like for example the onboard\nprogrammer of a ST Nucleo board, you could install something like this as\n/etc/udev/rules.d/99-stlinkv2-1.rules:\n# stm32 nucleo boards, with onboard st/linkv2-1\n# ie, STM32F0, STM32F4.\n# STM32VL has st/linkv1, which is quite different\n\nSUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0483\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"374b\", \\\n    MODE:=\"0660\", GROUP=\"dialout\", \\\n    SYMLINK+=\"stlinkv2-1_%n\"\nInstalling your first application\nA kernel alone isn't much use, as an embedded developer you want to\nsee some LEDs blink.  Fortunately, there is an example blink app\navailable from the TockOS app repository which tockloader can\ndownload and install (if you are using a board that is supported\nby tockloader).\nFor certain boards (e.g. Hail and imix), tockloader can read\nattributes from the board to configure how it communicates with the\nboard. For many boards, however, tockloader cannot know\nwhich board and communication method you want to use, so you have to\ntell it explicitly. For example:\n$ tockloader install --board nrf52dk --jlink blink\nCould not find TAB named \"blink\" locally.\n\n[0]     No\n[1]     Yes\n\nWould you like to check the online TAB repository for that app?[0] 1\nInstalling apps on the board...\nUsing known arch and jtag-device for known board nrf52dk\nFinished in 2.567 seconds\n\nBoards that use openocd will of course require the parameter\n--openocd instead of --jlink.  If your board has a serial\nbootloader, tockloader should work without any additional arguments:\n$ tockloader install blink\nHowever, you can specify the board type manually as well:\n$ tockloader install --board imix blink\nYou can also tell it which serial port to use (which is useful if you\nhave multiple boards plugged in) by passing it the --port parameter\nlike --port /dev/ttyACM0 to use /dev/ttyACM0:\n$ tockloader --port /dev/ttyACM0 install blink\nTo see the list of boards tockloader knows about you can run:\n$ tockloader list-known-boards\nIf everything has worked until here, the LEDs on your board should now\ndisplay a binary counter. Congratulations, you have a working TockOS\ninstallation on your board!\nCompiling applications\nThe last remaining step is to compile applications locally.\nAll user-level code lives in two separate repositories:\n\nlibtock-c: C and C++ apps.\nlibtock-rs: Rust apps.\n\nThe C version of the Tock library and the example applications is older and more\nstable, so it is a good idea to look at these first. So look at the libtock-c\nREADME and follow the\nsteps therein.  Then you can do the same for the libtock-rs\nREADME.  This should\ngive you a first impression of how to build and deploy applications for TockOS.\nFor an introduction on how applications work in TockOS, have a look at\nthe \"Userland\" document in this directory.\nDeveloping TockOS\nFormatting Rust source code\nRust includes a tool for automatically formatting Rust source\ncode. Simply run:\n$ make format\nfrom the root of the repository to format all rust code in the repository.\nKeeping build tools up to date\nOccasionally, Tock updates to a new nightly version of Rust. The build system\nautomatically checks whether the versions of rustc and rustup are correct\nfor the build requirements, and updates them when necessary.

ターゲットトリプル\nPLATFORM=hail                   # ボード名をここに\n\ninclude ../Makefile.common      # ../ ボートは$(TOCK)/boards/にあると仮定\n\nTockはビルドシステムのほとんどを担当するboards/Makefile.commonを\n提供しています。一般的には、このMakefileを掘り下げる必要はありません。\nもし、何かが動作していないようであれば、slackで聞いてみてください。\nビルドしたカーネルをボードにのせる\nカーネルのビルドに加えて、ボードのMakefileには、ボードにコードをのせる\nための規則も含める必要があります。これは当然ボード固有のものになりますが、\n通常、Tockには2つのターゲットが用意されています。\n\nprogram: 「プラグインプラグ」方式のロード用です。通常、ボードには\nブートローダやその他のサポートICが搭載されています。通常操作として、\nユーザはボードをプラグインしてmake programと入力するだけで\nコードをロードできることが期待されます。\nflash: 「より直接的な」ロード用です。通常、JTAGまたは同等の\nインターフェイスが使用されることを意味します。多くの場合、外部\nハードウェアが必要であることを意味します。ただし、開発キットボードの\n中にはJTAGが内蔵されているものもあるので、外部ハードウェアは厳しい\n条件ではありません。\n\nprogramやflashをサポートしない場合は、ボードにプログラムする方法を\n説明した次のような空の規則を定義する必要があります。\n.PHONY: program\n        echo \"To program, run SPEICAL_COMMAND\"\n        exit 1\n\nボード用のREADME\nすべてのボードは、クレートのトップレベルにREADME.mdファイルを\n置かなくてはいけません。このファイルには以下を記載します。\n\nプラットフォームに関する情報とプラットフォームの購入/入手方法へのリンクを\n提供する。プラットフォームに異なるバージョンがある場合は、テストに\n使用したバージョンを明記する。\n必要な追加の依存関係を含むハードウェアをプログラムする方法に課する\n概要を含める。\n\nアプリケーションのロード\nTockloaderが (おそらくは\nいくつかのフラグに特定の値を設定することにより）ボードへのアプリのロードを\nサポートするはずです。もしそうでない場合は、Tockloaderのリポジトリで\n課題を作成してください。そうすれば対象のボードに対するローディングコードを\nサポートするようツールを更新することができます。\nよくある落とし穴\n\nボードのmain.rsファイルを設定する際には注意が必要です。特に、\nコールバックが失われないように、カプセルに必要なset_client関数が\nすべて呼び出されていることを確認することが重要です。これらを忘れると、\nプラットフォームが何もしない結果になることが多いです。\n\nAdding a Platform to Tock Repository\nAfter creating a new platform, we would be thrilled to have it included in\nmainline Tock. However, Tock has a few guidelines for the minimum requirements\nof a board that is merged into the main Tock repository:\n\nThe hardware must be widely available. Generally that means the hardware\nplatform can be purchased online.\nThe port of Tock to the platform must include at least:\nConsole support so that debug!() and printf() work.\nTimer support.\nGPIO support with interrupt functionality.\n\n\nThe contributor must be willing to maintain the platform, at least initially,\nand help test the platform for future releases.\n\nWith these requirements met we should be able to merge the platform into Tock\nrelatively quickly. In the pull request to add the platform, you should add this\nchecklist:\n### New Platform Checklist\n\n- [ ] Hardware is widely available.\n- [ ] I can support the platform, which includes release testing for the platform, at least initially.\n- Basic features are implemented:\n  - [ ] `Console`, including `debug!()` and userspace `printf()`.\n  - [ ] Timers.\n  - [ ] GPIO with interrupts.\n\n"},"OutOfTree.html":{"url":"OutOfTree.html","title":"Out of Tree Boards","keywords":"","body":"Out of Tree Tock\nThis guide covers best practices for maintaining subsytems not in the\nTock master repository.\nIt is a work in progress.

Introduction\nAs Tock supports more chips and services, changes to core interfaces or\ncapsules will increasingly trigger bugs or integration problems. This\ndocument describes the process by which pull requests for the main\nTock repository are handled. This process is not set in stone, and may\nchange as problems or issues arise.\nActive development occurs on the master branch. Periodic releases (discussed\nmore below) are made on branches.\n2. Pull Requests\nAny pull request against the master branch is reviewed by the core Tock\nteam. Pull requests fall into two categories:\n\nUpkeep pull requests involve minor changes to existing implementations.\nExamples of upkeep requests involve bug fixes, documentation (that isn't\nspecification), or minor reimplementations of existing modules.\nSignificant pull requests involve new modules, significant\nre-implementations, new traits, new kernel components, or changes to the\nbuild system.\n\nWhether a pull request is upkeep or significant is based not only on the\nmagnitude of the change but also what sort of code is changed. For example,\nbug fixes that are considered upkeep for a non-critical capsule might be\nconsidered significant for kernel code, because the kernel code affects\neverything and has more potential edge cases.\nThe core team decides whether a pull request is upkeep or significant. The\nfirst person to look at the pull request can decide, or defer based on\nother core member feedback. Pull requests by a member of the core team need\nto be reviewed by a different member of the core team. If a team member\ndecides that a pull request is significant but another team member decided\nit was upkeep and merged it, then the merging team member is responsible for\nbacking out the merge and resolving the discussion. Any team member\ncan decide that a pull request is significant. The assumption is that the\ncore team will have good consensus on the boundary between upkeep vs.\nsignificant, but that specialized knowledge means that some team members will\nsee implications that others may not.\nUpkeep pull requests can be merged by any member of the core team. That\nperson is responsible for the merge and backing out the merge if needed.\nSignificant pull requests require review by the entire core team. Each\ncore team member is expected to respond within one week. There are three\npossible responses:\n\nAccept, which means the pull request should be accepted (perhaps\nwith some minor tweaks, as per comments).\nNo Comment, which means the pull request is fine but the member\ndoes not promote it.\nDiscuss, which means the pull request needs to be discussed by the\ncore team before considering merging it.\n\nCore team members can change their votes at any time, based on discussion,\nchanges, or further thought.\n3. Continuous Integration\nTock leans heavily on automated integration testing and as a project is\ngenerally willing to explore new and novel means of testing for hardware\nreliability.\nWith exceptions for drafts or works-in-progress, generally it is expected that\na pull request pass the full continuous integration (CI) suite before core team\nmembers will perform an in-depth review.\nOne frequent challenge with CI setups is replicating failures in local\ndevelopment environments. Tock goes to great lengths to mitigate this as much\nas possible. Within reason, the inability to replicate a CI test in a local\ndevelopment environment shall be considered a bug (however, it is reasonable\nthat local CI requires the install of non-trivial tooling, so long as there is\na well-documented, reliable path to set up the tooling locally).\nCI Organization\nAll CI is driven by make rules.\nGenerally, there are a series of fine-grained targets that do the actual tests,\nand then a meta layer of rules that are invoked depending on context.\nThe short answer: make prepush\nThis is a meta-target that runs what Tock considers the \"standard developer CI\".\nThis is the rule that should be run locally before submitting PRs.\nIt runs the quicker jobs that catch the majority of small errors.\nDevelopers are encouraged to consider wiring this to the\ngit pre-push hook\nto run automatically when pushing upstream.\nThe complete CI setup\nAll CI is required to support the possibility of parallel make invocation (i.e.\nmake -jN), but is not required to handle multiple independent make processes.\nci-job-*\nTo the extent reasonable, individual tests are broken into small atomic units.\nAll actionable make recipes that run tests must be in ci-job-* rules.\nThese perform individual, logical actions related only to testing.\nThese rules must not perform any one-off or setup operations.\nNo automated tooling should invoke job rules directly.\nIf a CI check fails, developers should be able to run the failed ci-job-*\nlocally, although in certain cases this may require installing supporting\ntooling.\nci-setup-*\nThese are rules that run any required setup for jobs to succeed.\nThey may install arbitrary packages or do any other significant labor.\nMany jobs may rely on the same setup target.\nTo the extent possible, setup targets should cache their results to avoid\nre-execution.\nSetup targets should handle upgrades automatically; this may include\nautomatically clearing caches or other artifacts if needed.\nSetup targets may handle downgrades, but developers working on experimental\nbranches may be required to handle these cases manually.\nSetup targets are permitted to expect \"total ownership\" of the directories they\ncreate and manage.\nSetup rules may vary between runner and local environments, as they may perform\nautomatic and possibly invasive (e.g. apt install) operations on runners.\nWhen run locally, setup targets must prompt users prior to system-wide\npersistent changes.\nThese prompts should be rare, as example, asking the user to install\nsystem-wide development packages needed for a build.\nThese prompts must not generate on every invocation of the setup rule;\nthat is, setup rules must first check if the install has already been\ncompleted and not prompt the user in that case.\nIf an update or upgrade is required, setup targets must prompt before\ninstalling.\nci-runner-*[-*]\nThese are targets like ci-runner-netlify and ci-runner-github.\nThey represent exactly what is run by various CI runners.\nFor platform with multiple CI rules, like GitHub, the ci-runner-github is a\nmeta target that runs all GitHub checks, while ci-runner-github-* are the\nrules that match the individual runners.\nThese targets must execute correctly on a local development environment.\nSmall deviations in behavior between the runner and local execution are\npermitted if needed, but should be kept to a minimum.\nci-all\nA meta target that runs every piece of CI possible.\nIf this passes locally, all upstream CI checks should pass.\n4. Reviews\nTo be merged, a pull request requires two Accept and no Discuss votes. The\nreview period begins when a review is requested from the Github team\ncore-team. If a member does not respond within a week, their vote is\nconsidered No Comment. If a core team member stops responding to many\nsignificant pull requests they may be removed from the core team.\nCore team members enter their votes through GitHub's comment system. An\n\"Approve\" is considered an Accept vote, a \"Comment\" is considered a \"No\nComment\" vote and a \"Request Changes\" is considered a \"Discuss\". If, after\ndiscussion, non-trivial changes are necessary for the pull request, the review\nwindow is re-started after the changes are made.\n5. Release Process\nTock releases are milestone-based, with a rough expectation that a new release\nof Tock would occur every 3-12 months. Before a release, a set of issues are\ntagged with the release-blocker tag, and the release will be tested when all\nof the release-blocker issues are closed. One week before the intended release\ndate, all new pull requests are put on hold, and everyone uses/tests the\nsoftware using the established testing process. Bug fixes for the release are\nmarked as such (in the title) and applied quickly. Once the release is ready,\nthe core team makes a branch with the release number and pull request reviews\nrestart.\nRelease branches are named release-[version]. For example, 'release-1.4.1'.\nPatches may be made against release branches to fix bugs.\nNote: Previously, Tock operated with a time-based release policy with the goal\nof creating a release every two months. The intent was these periodic stable\nreleases would make it easier for users to install and track changes to Tock.\nHowever, the overhead of keeping to that schedule was too daunting to make the\nreleases reliably timed, and it often did not fit well with the inclusion of\nmajor features which might be in-flight at a release point.\nOther Tock Repositories\nThis document covers the procedure of the core Tock repository\n(tock/tock). However, there are several other\nrepositories that are part of the greater Tock project.\nUserland Repositories\nTock has two userland environments that are heavily developed and supported:\n\ntock/libtock-c The C/C++ runtime was\nthe first runtime developed. It is fairly stable at this point and sees\nprimarily maintenance support as needed. Its development process follows\nthe main tock repository, with the same core team.\ntock/libtock-rs The Rust runtime is an\nactive work-in-progress. While basic application scenarios work, there are\nstill major architectural changes coming as it converges. Thus, the Rust\nruntime follows a slightly less formal model to allow it to move faster.\nPrimary owners of the Rust runtime are:\n\n@alevy\n@Woyten\n@torfmaster\n@jrvanwhy\n\nHowever the Tock core working group reserves the right to make final\nauthoritative decisions if need merits.\n\n\nTertiary Repositories\nTock has several additional smaller support repositories. These generally do\nnot have any formal contribution guidelines beyond pull requests and approval\nfrom the primary maintainer(s). Any member of the core working group can merge\nPRs in these repositories, however, generally things are deferred to the owner\nof the component.\n\ntock/book Getting start guide and tutorials\nfor Tock.\nPrimarily maintained by @alevy and @bradjc (Dec 2019).\ntock/elf2tab Tool to convert apps from\n.elf to Tock Application Bundles aka .tabs.\nPrimarily maintained by @bradjc (Dec 2019).\ntock/tockloader Tool for loading Tock\nkernel and applications onto hardware boards.\nPrimarily maintained by @bradjc (Dec 2019).\ntock/tock-archive Components of Tock\n(often hardware platforms) no longer under active development.\nMaintained by the core working group (Dec 2019).\ntock/tock-bootloader Utility for\nflashing apps via USB; works with tockloader.\nPrimarily maintained by @bradjc (Dec 2019).\ntock/tock-www The tockos.org website.\nPrimarily maintained by @alevy and @ppannuto (Dec 2019).\n\nOther repositories under tock/ are either\nexperimental or archived.\n"}}}
